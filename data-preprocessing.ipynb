      "It began in a Woman’s Club in London on a February afternoon—an\n",
      "uncomfortable club, and a miserable afternoon—when Mrs. Wilkins, who\n",
      "had come down from Hampstead to shop and had lunched at her club, took\n",
      "up The Times from the table in the smoking-room, and running her\n",
      "listless eye down the Agony Column saw this:\n",
      "\n",
      "  To Those who Appreciate Wistaria and Sunshine. Small mediaeval\n",
      "    Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let\n",
      "    Furnished for the month of April. Necessary servants remain. Z,\n",
      "    Box 1000, The Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the\n",
      "conceiver was unaware of it at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had\n",
      "then and there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with\n",
      "a gesture that was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the\n",
      "window and stared drearily out at the dripping street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially\n",
      "described as small. Not for her the shores in April of the\n",
      "Mediterranean, and the wistaria and sunshine. Such delights were only\n",
      "for the rich. Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who\n",
      "appreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too\n",
      "to her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew;\n",
      "more than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she\n",
      "possessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year,\n",
      "put by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had\n",
      "scraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield\n",
      "and refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her\n",
      "father, was £100 a year, so that Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes were what\n",
      "her husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming, and her\n",
      "acquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was\n",
      "seldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it\n",
      "which got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad\n",
      "housekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins’s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. “You never\n",
      "know,” he said, “when there will be a rainy day, and you may be very\n",
      "glad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue—hers was an\n",
      "economical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for\n",
      "Shoolbred’s, where she shopped—Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some\n",
      "time very drearily, her mind’s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and\n",
      "the wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her\n",
      "bodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling\n",
      "steadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly\n",
      "wondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh—Mellersh\n",
      "was Mr. Wilkins—had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether\n",
      "to get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn’t\n",
      "perhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her\n",
      "savings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part.\n",
      "The castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and\n",
      "dilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn’t in the least mind a few\n",
      "of them, because you didn’t pay for dilapidations which were already\n",
      "there; on the contrary—by reducing the price you had to pay they really\n",
      "paid you. But what nonsense to think of it \n",
      "\n",
      "She turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled\n",
      "irritation and resignation with which she had laid down The Times,\n",
      "and crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her\n",
      "mackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the\n",
      "overcrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred’s on her way home and\n",
      "buying some soles for Mellersh’s dinner—Mellersh was difficult with\n",
      "fish and liked only soles, except salmon—when she beheld Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and\n",
      "belonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room\n",
      "on which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn,\n",
      "in the first page of The Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to\n",
      "one of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided\n",
      "and registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go\n",
      "out, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in\n",
      "Hampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of\n",
      "them and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and\n",
      "she had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them,\n",
      "and she didn’t know what to say. She used to murmur, “Marvellous,” and\n",
      "feel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody\n",
      "took any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not\n",
      "noticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her\n",
      "practically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was\n",
      "reluctant; she was shy. And if one’s clothes and face and conversation\n",
      "are all negligible, thought Mrs. Wilkins, who recognised her\n",
      "disabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man,\n",
      "who gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was\n",
      "very respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior\n",
      "partners. His sister’s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately\n",
      "intelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent;\n",
      "he never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever\n",
      "say a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies\n",
      "of everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often\n",
      "happened that people who met him at these parties became discontented\n",
      "with their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness\n",
      "extricated themselves and went to Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. “She,” said his sister, with\n",
      "something herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her\n",
      "manner, “should stay at home.” But Wilkins could not leave his wife at\n",
      "home. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them.\n",
      "With his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he\n",
      "went to church. Being still fairly young—he was thirty-nine—and\n",
      "ambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his\n",
      "practice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and\n",
      "it was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never through\n",
      "words, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would\n",
      "come in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly\n",
      "five minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted\n",
      "into their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their\n",
      "preliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling\n",
      "organ, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the\n",
      "litanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She\n",
      "had a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used\n",
      "to make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days\n",
      "when she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient\n",
      "one wouldn’t be depressed, and that if one does one’s job well one\n",
      "becomes automatically bright and brisk.\n",
      "\n",

      "still, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as\n",

      "Arbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were\n",
      "quite close to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with\n",
      "eyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak\n",
      "to her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She\n",
      "did not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How\n",
      "stupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked\n",
      "so unhappy. Why couldn’t two unhappy people refresh each other on their\n",
      "way through this dusty business of life by a little talk—real, natural\n",
      "talk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still\n",
      "tried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot,\n",
      "too, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the\n",
      "very part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be\n",
      "like—the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea\n",
      "among little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of\n",
      "Shaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at\n",
      "Shoolbred’s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and to-morrow the\n",
      "same and the day after the same and always the same \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Mrs. Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. “Are you\n",
      "reading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?” she heard herself\n",
      "asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally Mrs. Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much\n",
      "surprised as Mrs. Wilkins was at herself for asking.\n",
      "\n",

      "freckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a\n",
      "smashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without\n",
      "answering. She was reading about the mediaeval castle and the\n",
      "wistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since\n",
      "then had been lost in dreams—of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the\n",
      "soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you ask me that?” she said in her grave voice, for her training\n",
      "of and by the poor had made her grave and patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. “Oh,\n",
      "only because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps—I thought somehow—”\n",
      "she stammered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into\n",
      "lists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully\n",
      "at Mrs. Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her,\n",
      "she could most properly be put.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I know you by sight,” went on Mrs. Wilkins, who, like all the shy,\n",
      "once she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more\n",
      "speech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. “Every\n",
      "Sunday—I see you every Sunday in church—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In church?” echoed Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this seems such a wonderful thing—this advertisement about the\n",
      "wistaria—and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and\n",
      "wriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed\n",
      "schoolgirl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems so wonderful,” she went on in a kind of burst, “and—it is\n",
      "such a miserable day ”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then she sat looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot with the eyes of an\n",
      "imprisoned dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This poor thing,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in\n",
      "helping and alleviating, “needs advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you see me in church,” she said, kindly and attentively, “I suppose\n",
      "you live in Hampstead too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long\n",
      "thin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed\n",
      "her, “Oh yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally\n",
      "first proceeded to collect the facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part\n",
      "of The Times where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed\n",
      "words of it were precious, only said, “Perhaps that’s why this seems\n",
      "so wonderful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No—I think that’s wonderful anyhow,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, forgetting\n",
      "facts and faintly sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you were reading it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t it be wonderful?” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wonderful,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded\n",
      "into patience again. “Very wonderful,” she said. “But it’s no use\n",
      "wasting one’s time thinking of such things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but it is,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s quick, surprising reply;\n",
      "surprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her—the\n",
      "characterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of\n",
      "hair straggling out. “And just the considering of them is worth while\n",
      "in itself—such a change from Hampstead—and sometimes I believe—I really\n",
      "do believe—if one considers hard enough one gets things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she,\n",
      "supposing she had to, put her?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” she said, leaning forward a little, “you will tell me your\n",
      "name. If we are to be friends”—she smiled her grave smile—“as I hope we\n",
      "are, we had better begin at the beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes—how kind of you. I’m Mrs. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\n",
      "expect,” she added, flushing, as Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, “that it\n",
      "conveys anything to you. Sometimes it—it doesn’t seem to convey\n",
      "anything to me either. But”—she looked round with a movement of seeking\n",
      "help—“I am Mrs. Wilkins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of\n",
      "facetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a\n",
      "pugdog’s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with\n",
      "it. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her\n",
      "husband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs.\n",
      "Mellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she\n",
      "thought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasising it in the way\n",
      "Chatsworth on the gate-posts of a villa emphasises the villa.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for\n",
      "the above reason, and after a pause—Mellersh was much too prudent to\n",
      "speak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a\n",
      "careful mental copy of his coming observation—he said, much displeased,\n",
      "“But I am not a villa,” and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for\n",
      "perhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course he was not a villa, Mrs. Wilkins assured him; she had never\n",
      "supposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning  she was only just\n",
      "thinking \n",
      "\n",
      "The more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh’s hope,\n",
      "familiar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two\n",
      "years, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; and they\n",
      "had a prolonged quarrel, if that can be called a quarrel which is\n",
      "conducted with dignified silence on one side and earnest apology on the\n",
      "other, as to whether or no Mrs. Wilkins had intended to suggest that\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins was a villa.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” she had thought when it was at last over—it took a long\n",
      "while—“that anybody would quarrel about anything when they’ve not\n",
      "left off being together for a single day for two whole years. What we\n",
      "both need is a holiday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My husband,” went on Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Arbuthnot, trying to throw\n",
      "some light on herself, “is a solicitor. He—” She cast about for\n",
      "something she could say elucidatory of Mellersh, and found: “He’s very\n",
      "handsome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot kindly, “that must be a great pleasure to\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” asked Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little taken aback, for constant\n",
      "intercourse with the poor had accustomed her to have her pronouncements\n",
      "accepted without question, “because beauty—handsomeness—is a gift like\n",
      "any other, and if it is properly used—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She trailed off into silence. Mrs. Wilkins’s great grey eyes were fixed\n",
      "on her, and it seemed suddenly to Mrs. Arbuthnot that perhaps she was\n",
      "becoming crystallised into a habit of exposition, and of exposition\n",
      "after the manner of nursemaids, through having an audience that\n",
      "couldn’t but agree, that would be afraid, if it wished, to interrupt,\n",
      "that didn’t know, that was, in fact, at her mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Wilkins was not listening; for just then, absurd as it seemed,\n",
      "a picture had flashed across her brain, and there were two figures in\n",
      "it sitting together under a great trailing wistaria that stretched\n",
      "across the branches of a tree she didn’t know, and it was herself and\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot—she saw them—she saw them. And behind them, bright in\n",
      "sunshine, were old grey walls—the mediaeval castle—she saw it—they\n",
      "were there \n",
      "\n",
      "She therefore stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot and did not hear a word she\n",
      "said. And Mrs. Arbuthnot stared too at Mrs. Wilkins, arrested by the\n",
      "expression on her face, which was swept by the excitement of what she\n",
      "saw, and was as luminous and tremulous under it as water in sunlight\n",
      "when it is ruffled by a gust of wind. At this moment, if she had been\n",
      "at a party, Mrs. Wilkins would have been looked at with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stared at each other; Mrs. Arbuthnot surprised, inquiringly, Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation. Of course.\n",
      "That was how it could be done. She herself, she by herself, couldn’t\n",
      "afford it, and wouldn’t be able, even if she could afford it, to go\n",
      "there all alone; but she and Mrs. Arbuthnot together \n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned across the table. “Why don’t we try and get it?” she\n",
      "whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot became even more wide-eyed. “Get it?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, still as though she were afraid of being\n",
      "overheard. “Not just sit here and say How wonderful, and then go home\n",
      "to Hampstead without having put out a finger—go home just as usual and\n",
      "see about the dinner and the fish just as we’ve been doing for years\n",
      "and years and will go on doing for years and years. In fact,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins, flushing to the roots of her hair, for the sound of what she\n",
      "was saying, of what was coming pouring out, frightened her, and yet she\n",
      "couldn’t stop, “I see no end to it. There is no end to it. So that\n",
      "there ought to be a break, there ought to be intervals—in everybody’s\n",
      "interests. Why, it would really be being unselfish to go away and be\n",
      "happy for a little, because we would come back so much nicer. You see,\n",
      "after a bit everybody needs a holiday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—how do you mean, get it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take it,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rent it. Hire it. Have it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—do you mean you and I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Between us. Share. Then it would only cost half, and you look\n",
      "so—you look exactly as if you wanted it just as much as I do—as if you\n",
      "ought to have a rest—have something happy happen to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, but we don’t know each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But just think how well we would if we went away together for a month!\n",
      "And I’ve saved for a rainy day, and I expect so have you, and this is\n",
      "the rainy day—look at it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is unbalanced,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet she felt strangely\n",
      "stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think of getting away for a whole month—from everything—to heaven—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “The\n",
      "vicar—” Yet she felt strangely stirred. It would indeed be wonderful to\n",
      "have a rest, a cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Habit, however, steadied her again; and years of intercourse with the\n",
      "poor made her say, with the slight though sympathetic superiority of\n",
      "the explainer, “But then, you see, heaven isn’t somewhere else. It is\n",
      "here and now. We are told so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She became very earnest, just as she did when trying patiently to help\n",
      "and enlighten the poor. “Heaven is within us,” she said in her gentle\n",
      "low voice. “We are told that on the very highest authority. And you\n",
      "know the lines about the kindred points, don’t you—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, I know them,” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The kindred points of heaven and home,” continued Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\n",
      "was used to finishing her sentences. “Heaven is in our home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins, again surprisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot was taken aback. Then she said gently, “Oh, but it is.\n",
      "It is there if we choose, if we make it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do choose, and I do make it, and it isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Arbuthnot was silent, for she too sometimes had doubts about\n",
      "homes. She sat and looked uneasily at Mrs. Wilkins, feeling more and\n",
      "more the urgent need to getting her classified. If she could only\n",
      "classify Mrs. Wilkins, get her safely under her proper heading, she\n",
      "felt that she herself would regain her balance, which did seem very\n",
      "strangely to be slipping all to one side. For neither had she had a\n",
      "holiday for years, and the advertisement when she saw it had set her\n",
      "dreaming, and Mrs. Wilkins’s excitement about it was infectious, and\n",
      "she had the sensation, as she listened to her impetuous, odd talk and\n",
      "watched her lit-up face, that she was being stirred out of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly Mrs. Wilkins was unbalanced, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had met the\n",
      "unbalanced before—indeed she was always meeting them—and they had no\n",
      "effect on her own stability at all; whereas this one was making her\n",
      "feel quite wobbly, quite as though to be off and away, away from her\n",
      "compass points of God, Husband, Home and Duty—she didn’t feel as if\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins intended Mr. Wilkins to come too—and just for once be\n",
      "happy, would be both good and desirable. Which of course it wasn’t;\n",
      "which certainly of course it wasn’t. She, also, had a nest-egg,\n",
      "invested gradually in the Post Office Savings Bank, but to suppose that\n",
      "she would ever forget her duty to the extent of drawing it out and\n",
      "spending it on herself was surely absurd. Surely she couldn’t, she\n",
      "wouldn’t ever do such a thing? Surely she wouldn’t, she couldn’t ever\n",
      "forget her poor, forget misery and sickness as completely as that? No\n",
      "doubt a trip to Italy would be extraordinarily delightful, but there\n",
      "were many delightful things one would like to do, and what was strength\n",
      "given to one for except to help one not to do them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Steadfast as the points of the compass to Mrs. Arbuthnot were the great\n",
      "four facts of life: God, Husband, Home, Duty. She had gone to sleep on\n",
      "these facts years ago, after a period of much misery, her head resting\n",
      "on them as on a pillow; and she had a great dread of being awakened out\n",
      "of so simple and untroublesome a condition. Therefore it was that she\n",
      "searched with earnestness for a heading under which to put Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins, and in this way illumine and steady her own mind; and sitting\n",
      "there looking at her uneasily after her last remark, and feeling\n",
      "herself becoming more and more unbalanced and infected, she decided\n",
      "pro tem, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading\n",
      "Nerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the\n",
      "category Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final\n",
      "categories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay\n",
      "that she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them\n",
      "out again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Nerves. Probably she had no regular work for others, thought Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot; no work that would take her outside herself. Evidently she\n",
      "was rudderless—blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost\n",
      "certainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her.\n",
      "Poor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning\n",
      "hand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table,\n",
      "to see the length of Mrs. Wilkins’s legs. All she saw was her small,\n",
      "eager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish\n",
      "longing in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make\n",
      "her happy. No; such things didn’t make people happy, such fleeting\n",
      "things. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick—he\n",
      "was her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was now\n",
      "thirty-three—where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be\n",
      "found, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others;\n",
      "they are to be found only—hadn’t she over and over again taken her\n",
      "disappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?—at\n",
      "the feet of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick had been the kind of husband whose wife betakes herself early\n",
      "to the feet of God. From him to them had been a short though painful\n",
      "step. It seemed short to her in retrospect, but it had really taken the\n",
      "whole of the first year of their marriage, and every inch of the way\n",
      "had been a struggle, and every inch of it was stained, she felt at the\n",
      "time, with her heart’s blood. All that was over now. She had long since\n",
      "found peace. And Frederick, from her passionately loved bridegroom,\n",
      "from her worshipped young husband, had become second only to God on\n",
      "her list of duties and forbearances. There he hung, the second in\n",
      "importance, a bloodless thing bled white by her prayers. For years she\n",
      "had been able to be happy only by forgetting happiness. She wanted to\n",
      "stay like that. She wanted to shut out everything that would remind her\n",
      "of beautiful things, that might set her off again longing, desiring....\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like so much to be friends,” she said earnestly. “Won’t you come\n",
      "and see me, or let me come to you sometimes? Whenever you feel as if\n",
      "you wanted to talk. I’ll give you my address”—she searched in her\n",

      "this egg had been corrupt, but she had at least supposed its end was to\n",
      "be creditable. Was she to deflect it from its intended destination,\n",
      "which alone had appeared to justify her keeping it, and spend it on\n",
      "giving herself pleasure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot spoke on and on, so much practised in the kind of speech\n",

      "That night in her prayers Mrs. Arbuthnot asked for guidance. She felt\n",

      "Frederick pressed money on her; and it would only mean, while she\n",
      "rolled up a second egg, that for a time her contributions to the parish\n",

      "\n",
      "For Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live\n",

      "the fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made\n",
      "his living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote\n",
      "immensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of\n",
      "kings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses,\n",
      "and there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so\n",
      "that he had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of\n",
      "his married life, and even so there were great further piles of these\n",
      "ladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether\n",
      "she liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave\n",
      "her a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir,\n",
      "with swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her\n",
      "a miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this\n",

      "fact that she and Frederick should draw their sustenance from guilt,\n",
      "however much purged by the passage of centuries, was one of the secret\n",
      "reasons of her sadness. The more the memoired lady had forgotten\n",
      "herself, the more his book about her was read and the more free-handed\n",
      "he was to his wife; and all that he gave her was spent, after adding\n",
      "slightly to her nest-egg—for she did hope and believe that some day\n",
      "people would cease to want to read of wickedness, and then Frederick\n",
      "would need supporting—on helping the poor. The parish flourished\n",
      "because, to take a handful at random, of the ill-behaviour of the\n",
      "ladies Du Barri, Montespan, Pompadour, Ninon de l’Enclos, and even of\n",
      "learned Maintenon. The poor were the filter through which the money\n",
      "was passed, to come out, Mrs. Arbuthnot hoped, purified. She could do\n",
      "no more. She had tried in days gone by to think the situation out, to\n",
      "discover the exact right course for her to take, but had found it, as\n",
      "she had found Frederick, too difficult, and had left it, as she had\n",
      "left Frederick, to God. Nothing of this money was spent on her house\n",
      "or dress; those remained, except for the great soft sofa, austere. It\n",
      "was the poor who profited. Their very boots were stout with sins. But\n",
      "how difficult it had been. Mrs. Arbuthnot, groping for guidance, prayed\n",
      "about it to exhaustion. Ought she perhaps to refuse to touch the money,\n",
      "to avoid it as she would have avoided the sins which were its source?\n",
      "But then what about the parish’s boots? She asked the vicar what he\n",
      "thought, and, through much delicate language, evasive and cautious, it\n",
      "did finally appear that he was for the boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least she had persuaded Frederick, when first he began his terrible\n",
      "successful career—he only began it after their marriage; when she\n",
      "married him he had been a blameless official attached to the library of\n",
      "the British Museum—to publish the memoirs under another name, so that\n",
      "she was not publicly branded. Hampstead read the books with glee, and\n",
      "had no idea that their writer lived in its midst. Frederick was almost\n",
      "unknown, even by sight, in Hampstead. He never went to any of its\n",
      "gatherings. Whatever it was he did in the way of recreation was done in\n",
      "London, but he never spoke of what he did or whom he saw; he might have\n",
      "been perfectly friendless for any mention he ever made of friends to\n",
      "his wife. Only the vicar knew where the money for the parish came from,\n",
      "and he regarded it, he told Mrs. Arbuthnot, as a matter of honour not\n",
      "to mention it.\n",
      "\n",

      "very jovial and good-natured and free-handed and glad if she would\n",
      "allow him to give her something—a well-fed man, contented with the\n",

      "wouldn’t be quite—and it was the only way, Mrs. Wilkins said, to keep\n",

      "say if he knew she was renting part of a mediaeval castle on her own\n",

      "too pleased for her to go, he would not mind it in the very least;\n",
      "indeed, he would hail such a manifestation of self-indulgence and\n",
      "worldliness with an amusement that would hurt, and urge her to have a\n",
      "good time and not to hurry home with a crushing detachment. Far better,\n",
      "she thought, to be missed by Mellersh than to be sped by Frederick. To\n",
      "be missed, to be needed, from whatever motive, was, she thought, better\n",
      "than the complete loneliness of not being missed or needed at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "She therefore said nothing, and allowed Mrs. Wilkins to leap at her\n",
      "conclusions unchecked. But they did, both of them, for a whole day feel\n",
      "that the only thing to be done was to renounce the mediaeval castle;\n",
      "and it was in arriving at this bitter decision that they really\n",
      "realised how acute had been their longing for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose mind was trained in the finding of ways out\n",
      "of difficulties, found a way out of the reference difficulty; and\n",
      "simultaneously Mrs. Wilkins had a vision revealing to her how to reduce\n",
      "the rent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot’s plan was simple, and completely successful. She took\n",
      "the whole of the rent in person to the owner, drawing it out of her\n",
      "Savings Bank—again she looked furtive and apologetic, as if the clerk\n",
      "must know the money was wanted for purposes of self-indulgence—and,\n",
      "going up with the six ten pound notes in her hand-bag to the address\n",
      "near the Brompton Oratory where the owner lived, presented them to him,\n",
      "waiving her right to pay only half. And when he saw her, and her parted\n",
      "hair and soft dark eyes and sober apparel, and heard her grave voice,\n",
      "he told her not to bother about writing round for those references.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’ll be all right,” he said, scribbling a receipt for the rent. “Do\n",
      "sit down, won’t you? Nasty day, isn’t it? You’ll find the old castle\n",
      "has lots of sunshine, whatever else it hasn’t got. Husband going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot, unused to anything but candour, looked troubled at this\n",
      "question and began to murmur inarticulately, and the owner at once\n",
      "concluded that she was a widow—a war one, of course, for other widows\n",
      "were old—and that he had been a fool not to guess it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’m sorry,” he said, turning red right up to his fair hair. “I\n",
      "didn’t mean—h’m, h’m, h’m—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran his eye over the receipt he had written. “Yes, I think that’s\n",
      "all right,” he said, getting up and giving it to her. “Now,” he added,\n",
      "taking the six notes she held out and smiling, for Mrs. Arbuthnot was\n",
      "agreeable to look at, “I’m richer, and you’re happier. I’ve got money,\n",
      "and you’ve got San Salvatore. I wonder which is best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot with her sweet smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed and opened the door for her. It was a pity the interview was\n",
      "over. He would have liked to ask her to lunch with him. She made him\n",
      "think of his mother, of his nurse, of all things kind and comforting,\n",
      "besides having the attraction of not being his mother or his nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you’ll like the old place,” he said, holding her hand a minute\n",
      "at the door. The very feel of her hand, even through its glove, was\n",
      "reassuring; it was the sort of hand, he thought, that children would\n",
      "like to hold in the dark. “In April, you know, it’s simply a mass of\n",
      "flowers. And then there’s the sea. You must wear white. You’ll fit in\n",
      "very well. There are several portraits of you there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Portraits?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madonnas, you know. There’s one on the stairs really exactly like\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot smiled and said good-bye and thanked him. Without the\n",
      "least trouble and at once she had got him placed in his proper\n",
      "category: he was an artist and of an effervescent temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook hands and left, and he wished she hadn’t. After she was gone\n",
      "he supposed that he ought to have asked for those references, if only\n",
      "because she would think him so unbusiness-like not to, but he could as\n",
      "soon have insisted on references from a saint in a nimbus as from that\n",
      "grave, sweet lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her letter, making the appointment, lay on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty name.\n",
      "\n",
      "That difficulty, then, was overcome. But there still remained the other\n",
      "one, the really annihilating effect of the expense on the nest-eggs,\n",
      "and especially on Mrs. Wilkins’s, which was in size, compared with Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot’s, as the egg of the plover to that of the duck; and this in\n",
      "its turn was overcome by the vision vouchsafed to Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "revealing to her the steps to be taken for its overcoming. Having got\n",
      "San Salvatore—the beautiful, the religious name, fascinated them—they\n",
      "in their turn would advertise in the Agony Column of The Times, and\n",
      "would inquire after two more ladies, of similar desires to their own,\n",
      "to join them and share the expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once the strain of the nest-eggs would be reduced from half to a\n",
      "quarter. Mrs. Wilkins was prepared to fling her entire egg into the\n",
      "adventure, but she realised that if it were to cost even sixpence over\n",
      "her ninety pounds her position would be terrible. Imagine going to\n",
      "Mellersh and saying, “I owe.” It would be awful enough if some day\n",
      "circumstances forced her to say, “I have no nest-egg,” but at least she\n",
      "would be supported in such a case by the knowledge that the egg had\n",
      "been her own. She therefore, though prepared to fling her last penny\n",
      "into the adventure, was not prepared to fling into it a single farthing\n",
      "that was not demonstrably her own; and she felt that if her share of\n",
      "the rent was reduced to fifteen pounds only, she would have a safe\n",
      "margin for the other expenses. Also they might economise very much on\n",
      "food—gather olives off their own trees and eat them, for instance, and\n",
      "perhaps catch fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, as they pointed out to each other, they could reduce the\n",
      "rent to an almost negligible sum by increasing the number of sharers;\n",
      "they could have six more ladies instead of two if they wanted to,\n",
      "seeing that there were eight beds. But supposing the eight beds were\n",
      "distributed in couples in four rooms, it would not be altogether what\n",
      "they wanted, to find themselves shut up at night with a stranger.\n",
      "Besides, they thought that perhaps having so many would not be quite\n",
      "so peaceful. After all, they were going to San Salvatore for peace and\n",
      "rest and joy, and six more ladies, especially if they got into one’s\n",
      "bedroom, might a little interfere with that.\n",
      "speech first\n",
      "However, there seemed to be only two ladies in England at that moment\n",
      "who had any wish to join them, for they had only two answers to their\n",
      "advertisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we only want two,” said Mrs. Wilkins, quickly recovering, for\n",
      "she had imagined a great rush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think a choice would have been a good thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean because then we needn’t have had Lady Caroline Dester.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t say that,” gently protested Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We needn’t have her,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Just one more person would\n",
      "help us a great deal with the rent. We’re not obliged to have two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why should we not have her? She seems really quite what we want.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—she does from her letter,” said Mrs. Wilkins doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt she would be terribly shy of Lady Caroline. Incredible as it\n",
      "may seem, seeing how they get into everything, Mrs. Wilkins had never\n",
      "come across any members of the aristocracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They interviewed Lady Caroline, and they interviewed the other\n",
      "applicant, a Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline came to the club in Shaftesbury Avenue, and appeared to\n",
      "be wholly taken up by one great longing, a longing to get away from\n",
      "everybody she had ever known. When she saw the club, and Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, and Mrs. Wilkins, she was sure that here was exactly what\n",
      "she wanted. She would be in Italy—a place she adored; she would not be\n",
      "in hotels—places she loathed; she would not be staying with\n",
      "friends—persons she disliked; and she would be in the company of\n",
      "strangers who would never mention a single person she knew, for the\n",
      "simple reason that they had not, could not have, and would not come\n",
      "across them. She asked a few questions about the fourth woman, and was\n",
      "satisfied with the answers. Mrs. Fisher, of Prince of Wales Terrace. A\n",
      "widow. She too would be unacquainted with any of her friends. Lady\n",
      "Caroline did not even know where Prince of Wales Terrace was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s in London,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it?” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all seemed most restful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher was unable to come to the club because, she explained by\n",
      "letter, she could not walk without a stick; therefore Mrs. Arbuthnot\n",
      "and Mrs. Wilkins went to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if she can’t come to the club how can she go to Italy?” wondered\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall hear that from her own lips,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Mrs. Fisher’s lips they merely heard, in reply to delicate\n",
      "questioning, that sitting in trains was not walking about; and they\n",
      "knew that already. Except for the stick, however, she appeared to be a\n",
      "most desirable fourth—quiet, educated, elderly. She was much older than\n",
      "they or Lady Caroline—Lady Caroline had informed them she was\n",
      "twenty-eight—but not so old as to have ceased to be active-minded. She\n",
      "was very respectable indeed, and still wore a complete suit of black\n",
      "though her husband had died, she told them, eleven years before. Her\n",
      "house was full of signed photographs of illustrious Victorian dead, all\n",
      "of whom she said she had known when she was little. Her father had been\n",
      "an eminent critic, and in his house she had seen practically everybody\n",
      "who was anybody in letters and art. Carlyle had scowled at her; Matthew\n",
      "Arnold had held her on his knee; Tennyson had sonorously rallied her on\n",
      "the length of her pig-tail. She animatedly showed them the photographs,\n",
      "hung everywhere on her walls, pointing out the signatures with her\n",
      "stick, and she neither gave any information about her own husband nor\n",
      "asked for any about the husbands of her visitors; which was the\n",
      "greatest comfort. Indeed, she seemed to think that they also were\n",
      "widows, for on inquiring who the fourth lady was to be, and being told\n",
      "it was a Lady Caroline Dester, she said, “Is she a widow too?” And on\n",
      "their explaining that she was not, because she had not yet been\n",
      "married, observed with abstracted amiability, “All in good time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Fisher’s very abstractedness—and she seemed to be absorbed\n",
      "chiefly in the interesting people she used to know and in their\n",
      "memorial photographs, and quite a good part of the interview was taken\n",
      "up by reminiscent anecdote of Carlyle, Meredith, Matthew Arnold,\n",
      "Tennyson, and a host of others—her very abstractedness was a\n",
      "recommendation. She only asked, she said, to be allowed to sit quiet in\n",
      "the sun and remember. That was all Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins\n",
      "asked of their sharers. It was their idea of a perfect sharer that she\n",
      "should sit quiet in the sun and remember, rousing herself on Saturday\n",
      "evenings sufficiently to pay her share. Mrs. Fisher was very fond, too,\n",
      "she said, of flowers, and once when she was spending a week-end with\n",
      "her father at Box Hill—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who lived at Box Hill?” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins, who hung on Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher’s reminiscences, intensely excited by meeting somebody who had\n",
      "actually been familiar with all the really and truly and undoubtedly\n",
      "great—actually seen them, heard them talking, touched them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher looked at her over the top of her glasses in some surprise.\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, in her eagerness to tear the heart out quickly of Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher’s reminiscences, afraid that at any moment Mrs. Arbuthnot would\n",
      "take her away and she wouldn’t have heard half, had already interrupted\n",
      "several times with questions which appeared ignorant to Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meredith of course,” said Mrs. Fisher rather shortly. “I remember a\n",
      "particular week-end”—she continued. “My father often took me, but I\n",
      "always remember this week-end particularly—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you know Keats?” eagerly interrupted Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, after a pause, said with sub-acid reserve that she had\n",
      "been unacquainted with both Keats and Shakespeare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh of course—how ridiculous of me!” cried Mrs. Wilkins, flushing\n",
      "scarlet. “It’s because”—she floundered—“it’s because the immortals\n",
      "somehow still seem alive, don’t they—as if they were here, going to\n",
      "walk into the room in another minute—and one forgets they are dead. In\n",
      "fact one knows perfectly well that they’re not dead—not nearly so dead\n",
      "as you and I even now,” she assured Mrs. Fisher, who observed her over\n",
      "the top of her glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought I saw Keats the other day,” Mrs. Wilkins incoherently\n",
      "proceeded, driven on by Mrs. Fisher’s look over the top of her glasses.\n",
      "“In Hampstead—crossing the road in front of that house—you know—the\n",
      "house where he lived—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot said they must be going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher did nothing to prevent them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really thought I saw him,” protested Mrs. Wilkins, appealing for\n",
      "belief first to one and then to the other while waves of colour passed\n",
      "over her face, and totally unable to stop because of Mrs. Fisher’s\n",
      "glasses and the steady eyes looking at her over their tops. “I believe\n",
      "I did see him—he was dressed in a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Mrs. Arbuthnot looked at her now, and in her gentlest voice said\n",
      "they would be late for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at this point that Mrs. Fisher asked for references. She had no\n",
      "wish to find herself shut up for four weeks with somebody who saw\n",
      "things. It is true that there were three sitting-rooms, besides the\n",
      "garden and the battlements at San Salvatore, so that there would be\n",
      "opportunities of withdrawal from Mrs. Wilkins; but it would be\n",
      "disagreeable to Mrs. Fisher, for instance, if Mrs. Wilkins were\n",
      "suddenly to assert that she saw Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher was dead; let\n",
      "him remain so. She had no wish to be told he was walking about the\n",
      "garden. The only reference she really wanted, for she was much too old\n",
      "and firmly seated in her place in the world for questionable associates\n",
      "to matter to her, was one with regard to Mrs. Wilkins’s health. Was her\n",
      "health quite normal? Was she an ordinary, everyday, sensible woman?\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher felt that if she were given even one address she would be\n",
      "able to find out what she needed. So she asked for references, and her\n",
      "visitors appeared to be so much taken aback—Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, was\n",
      "instantly sobered—that she added, “It is usual.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins found her speech first. “But,” she said, “aren’t we the\n",
      "ones who ought to ask for some from you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And this seemed to Mrs. Arbuthnot too the right attitude. Surely it was\n",
      "they who were taking Mrs. Fisher into their party, and not Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "who was taking them into it?\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Mrs. Fisher, leaning on her stick, went to the writing-table\n",
      "and in a firm hand wrote down three names and offered them to Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins, and the names were so respectable, more, they were so\n",
      "momentous, they were so nearly august, that just to read them was\n",
      "enough. The President of the Royal Academy, the Archbishop of\n",
      "Canterbury, and the Governor of the Bank of England—who would dare\n",
      "disturb such personages in their meditations with inquiries as to\n",
      "whether a female friend of theirs was all she should be?\n",
      "\n",
      "“They have known me since I was little,” said Mrs. Fisher—everybody\n",
      "seemed to have known Mrs. Fisher since or when she was little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think references are nice things at all between—between\n",
      "ordinary decent women,” burst out Mrs. Wilkins, made courageous by\n",
      "being, as she felt, at bay; for she very well knew that the only\n",
      "reference she could give without getting into trouble was Shoolbred,\n",
      "and she had little confidence in that, as it would be entirely based on\n",
      "Mellersh’s fish. “We’re not business people. We needn’t distrust each\n",
      "other—”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mrs. Arbuthnot said, with a dignity that yet was sweet, “I’m afraid\n",
      "references do bring an atmosphere into our holiday plan that isn’t\n",
      "quite what we want, and I don’t think we’ll take yours up or give you\n",
      "any ourselves. So that I suppose you won’t wish to join us.”\n",

      "Then Mrs. Fisher, her gaze diverted to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who inspired\n",
      "trust and liking even in Tube officials, felt that she would be idiotic\n",
      "to lose the opportunity of being in Italy in the particular conditions\n",
      "offered, and that she and this calm-browed woman between them would\n",
      "certainly be able to curb the other one when she had her attacks. So\n",
      "she said, taking Mrs. Arbuthnot’s offered hand, “Very well. I waive\n",

      "station, and the walk and the struggle on the crowded pavement with\n",

      "waiving Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there is any waiving to be done, do let us be the ones who waive,”\n",
      "she said eagerly.\n",

      "But Mrs. Arbuthnot, as usual, held on to Mrs. Wilkins; and presently,\n",
      "having cooled down in the train, Mrs. Wilkins announced that at San\n",
      "Salvatore Mrs. Fisher would find her level. “I see her finding her\n",

      "\n",
      "They had supposed and hoped that after a reasonable amount of village a\n",
      "mediaeval archway would loom upon them, and through it they would drive\n",
      "into a garden and draw up at an open, welcoming door, with light\n",
      "streaming from it and those servants standing in it who, according to\n",
      "the advertisement, remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead the fly suddenly stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peering out they could see they were still in the village street, with\n",
      "small dark houses each side; and Beppo, throwing the reins over the\n",
      "horse’s back as if completely confident this time that he would not go\n",
      "any farther, got down off his box. At the same moment, springing as it\n",
      "seemed out of nothing, a man and several half-grown boys appeared on\n",
      "each side of the fly and began dragging out the suit-cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no—San Salvatore, San Salvatore”—exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins, trying to\n",
      "hold on to what suit-cases she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sì, sì—San Salvatore,” they all shouted, pulling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This can’t be San Salvatore,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, who sat quite still watching her suit-cases being taken from\n",
      "her with the same patience she applied to lesser evils. She knew she\n",
      "could do nothing if these men were wicked men determined to have her\n",
      "suit-cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think it can be,” she admitted, and could not refrain from a\n",
      "moment’s wonder at the ways of God. Had she really been brought here,\n",
      "she and poor Mrs. Wilkins, after so much trouble in arranging it, so\n",
      "much difficulty and worry, along such devious paths of prevarication\n",
      "and deceit, only to be—\n",
      "\n",
      "She checked her thoughts, and gently said to Mrs. Wilkins, while the\n",
      "ragged youths disappeared with the suit-cases into the night and the\n",
      "man with the lantern helped Beppo pull the rug off her, that they were\n",
      "both in God’s hands; and for the first time on hearing this, Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins was afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing for it but to get out. Useless to try to go on\n",
      "sitting in the fly repeating San Salvatore. Every time they said it,\n",
      "and their voices each time were fainter, Beppo and the other man merely\n",
      "echoed it in a series of loud shouts. If only they had learned Italian\n",
      "when they were little. If only they could have said, “We wish to be\n",
      "driven to the door.” But they did not even know what door was in\n",
      "Italian. Such ignorance was not only contemptible, it was, they now\n",
      "saw, definitely dangerous. Useless, however, to lament it now. Useless\n",
      "to put off whatever it was that was going to happen to them by trying\n",
      "to go on sitting in the fly. They therefore got out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men opened their umbrellas for them and handed them to them.\n",
      "From this they received a faint encouragement, because they could not\n",
      "believe that if these men were wicked they would pause to open\n",
      "umbrellas. The man with the lantern then made signs to them to follow\n",
      "him, talking loud and quickly, and Beppo, they noticed, remained\n",
      "behind. Ought they to pay him? Not, they thought, if they were going to\n",
      "be robbed and perhaps murdered. Surely on such an occasion one did not\n",
      "pay. Besides, he had not after all brought them to San Salvatore. Where\n",
      "they had got to was evidently somewhere else. Also, he did not show the\n",
      "least wish to be paid; he let them go away into the night with no\n",
      "clamour at all. This, they could not help thinking, was a bad sign. He\n",
      "asked for nothing because presently he was to get so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to some steps. The road ended abruptly in a church and some\n",
      "descending steps. The man held the lantern low for them to see the\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“San Salvatore?” said Mrs. Wilkins once again, very faintly, before\n",
      "committing herself to the steps. It was useless to mention it now, of\n",
      "course, but she could not go down steps in complete silence. No\n",
      "mediaeval castle, she was sure, was ever built at the bottom of steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, however, came the echoing shout—“Sì, sì—San Salvatore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They descended gingerly, holding up their skirts just as if they would\n",
      "be wanting them another time and had not in all probability finished\n",
      "with skirts for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps ended in a steeply sloping path with flat stone slabs down\n",
      "the middle. They slipped a good deal on these wet slabs, and the man\n",
      "with the lantern, talking loud and quickly, held them up. His way of\n",
      "holding them up was polite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a low voice to Mrs. Arbuthnot, “It is\n",
      "all right after all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot again; and again Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins was afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the bottom of the sloping path, and the light of the\n",
      "lantern flickered over an open space with houses round three sides. The\n",
      "sea was the fourth side, lazily washing backwards and forwards on\n",
      "pebbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“San Salvatore,” said the man pointing with his lantern to a black mass\n",
      "curved round the water like an arm flung about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They strained their eyes. They saw the black mass, and on the top of it\n",
      "a light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“San Salvatore?” they both repeated incredulously, for where were the\n",
      "suit-cases, and why had they been forced to get out of the fly?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sì, sì—San Salvatore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went along what seemed to be a quay, right on the edge of the\n",
      "water. There was not even a low wall here—nothing to prevent the man\n",
      "with the lantern tipping them in if he wanted to. He did not, however,\n",
      "tip them in. Perhaps it was all right after all, Mrs. Wilkins again\n",
      "suggested to Mrs. Arbuthnot on noticing this, who this time was herself\n",
      "beginning to think that it might be, and said no more about God’s\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flicker of the lantern danced along, reflected in the wet pavement\n",
      "of the quay. Out to the left, in the darkness and evidently at the end\n",
      "of a jetty, was a red light. They came to an archway with a heavy iron\n",
      "gate. The man with the lantern pushed the gate open. This time they\n",
      "went up steps instead of down, and at the top of them was a little path\n",
      "that wound upwards among flowers. They could not see the flowers, but\n",
      "the whole place was evidently full of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It here dawned on Mrs. Wilkins that perhaps the reason why the fly had\n",
      "not driven them up to the door was that there was no road, only a\n",
      "footpath. That also would explain the disappearance of the suit-cases.\n",
      "She began to feel confident that they would find their suit-cases\n",
      "waiting for them when they got up to the top. San Salvatore was, it\n",
      "seemed, on the top of a hill, as a mediaeval castle should be. At a\n",
      "turn of the path they saw above them, much nearer now and shining more\n",
      "brightly, the light they had seen from the quay. She told Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot of her dawning belief, and Mrs. Arbuthnot agreed that it was\n",
      "very likely a true one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, but this time in a tone of real hopefulness, Mrs. Wilkins\n",
      "said, pointing upwards at the black outline against the only slightly\n",
      "less black sky, “San Salvatore?” And once more, but this time\n",
      "comfortingly, encouragingly, came back the assurance, “Sì, sì—San\n",
      "Salvatore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They crossed a little bridge, over what was apparently a ravine, and\n",
      "then came a flat bit with long grass at the sides and more flowers.\n",
      "They felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the\n",
      "invisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a\n",
      "zigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not\n",
      "see. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness. Higher and\n",
      "higher they went in this sweet darkness, and the red light on the jetty\n",
      "dropped farther and farther below them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path wound round to the other side of what appeared to be a little\n",
      "peninsula; the jetty and the red light disappeared; across the\n",
      "emptiness on their left were distant lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mezzago,” said the man, waving his lantern at the lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sì, sì,” they answered, for they had by now learned “sì, sì”. Upon\n",
      "which the man congratulated them in a great flow of polite words, not\n",
      "one of which they understood, on their magnificent Italian; for this\n",
      "was Domenico, the vigilant and accomplished gardener of San Salvatore,\n",
      "the prop and stay of the establishment, the resourceful, the gifted,\n",
      "the eloquent, the courteous, the intelligent Domenico. Only they did\n",
      "not know that yet; and he did in the dark, and even sometimes in the\n",
      "light, look, with his knife-sharp swarthy features and swift, panther\n",
      "movements, very like somebody wicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed along another flat bit of path, with a black shape like a\n",
      "high wall towering above them on their right, and then the path went up\n",
      "again under trellises, and trailing sprays of scented things caught at\n",
      "them and shook raindrops on them, and the light of the lantern\n",
      "flickered over lilies, and then came a flight of ancient steps worn\n",
      "with centuries, and then another iron gate, and then they were inside,\n",
      "though still climbing a twisting flight of stone steps with old walls\n",
      "on either side like the walls of dungeons, and with a vaulted roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top was a wrought-iron door, and through it shone a flood of\n",
      "electric light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ecco,” said Domenico, lithely running up the last few steps ahead\n",
      "and pushing the door open.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there they were, arrived; and it was San Salvatore; and their\n",
      "suit-cases were waiting for them; and they had not been murdered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at each other’s white faces and blinking eyes very\n",
      "solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great, a wonderful moment. Here they were, in their mediaeval\n",
      "castle at last. Their feet touched its stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins put her arm round Mrs. Arbuthnot’s neck and kissed her.\n",

      "“The first thing to happen in this house,” she said softly, solemnly,\n",
      "“shall be a kiss.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Domenico was delighted. He liked to see beautiful ladies kiss. He made\n",
      "them a most appreciative speech of welcome, and they stood arm in arm,\n",
      "holding each other up, for they were very tired, blinking smilingly at\n",
      "him, and not understanding a word.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Wilkins woke next morning she lay in bed a few minutes before\n",
      "getting up and opening the shutters. What would she see out of her\n",
      "window? A shining world, or a world of rain? But it would be beautiful;\n",
      "whatever it was would be beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in a little bedroom with bare white walls and a stone floor\n",
      "and sparse old furniture. The beds—there were two—were made of iron,\n",
      "enamelled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay\n",
      "putting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off\n",
      "opening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time\n",
      "it was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries\n",
      "ago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in\n",
      "the house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she\n",
      "had slept a long while—so completely rested, so perfectly content.\n",
      "She lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she\n",
      "was, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself:\n",
      "adorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Mellersh once\n",
      "now for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom\n",
      "of one’s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving\n",
      "the blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more\n",
      "comfortably! It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins longed to get up and open the shutters, but where she was\n",
      "was really so very delicious. She gave a sigh of contentment, and went\n",
      "on lying there looking round her, taking in everything in her room, her\n",
      "own little room, her very own to arrange just as she pleased for this\n",
      "one blessed month, her room bought with her own savings, the fruit of\n",
      "her careful denials, whose door she could bolt if she wanted to, and\n",
      "nobody had the right to come in. It was such a strange little room, so\n",
      "different from any she had known, and so sweet. It was like a cell.\n",
      "Except for the two beds, it suggested a happy austerity. “And the name\n",
      "of the chamber,” she thought, quoting and smiling round at it, “was\n",
      "Peace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, this was delicious, to lie there thinking how happy she was, but\n",
      "outside those shutters it was more delicious still. She jumped up,\n",
      "pulled on her slippers, for there was nothing on the stone floor but\n",
      "one small rug, ran to the window and threw open the shutters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” cried Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the radiance of April in Italy lay gathered together at her feet.\n",
      "The sun poured in on her. The sea lay asleep in it, hardly stirring.\n",
      "Across the bay the lovely mountains, exquisitely different in colour,\n",
      "were asleep too in the light; and underneath her window, at the bottom\n",
      "of the flower-starred grass slope from which the wall of the castle\n",
      "rose up, was a great cypress, cutting through the delicate blues and\n",
      "violets and rose-colours of the mountains and the sea like a great\n",
      "black sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared. Such beauty; and she there to see it. Such beauty; and she\n",
      "alive to feel it. Her face was bathed in light. Lovely scents came up\n",
      "to the window and caressed her. A tiny breeze gently lifted her hair.\n",
      "Far out in the bay a cluster of almost motionless fishing boats hovered\n",
      "like a flock of white birds on the tranquil sea. How beautiful, how\n",
      "beautiful. Not to have died before this  to have been allowed to\n",
      "see, breathe, feel this . She stared, her lips parted. Happy?\n",
      "Poor, ordinary, everyday word. But what could one say, how could one\n",
      "describe it? It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it\n",
      "was as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as\n",
      "though she were washed through with light. And how astonishing to feel\n",
      "this sheer bliss, for here she was, not doing and not going to do a\n",
      "single unselfish thing, not going to do a thing she didn’t want to do.\n",
      "According to everybody she had ever come across she ought at least to\n",
      "have twinges. She had not one twinge. Something was wrong somewhere.\n",
      "Wonderful that at home she should have been so good, so terribly good,\n",
      "and merely felt tormented. Twinges of every sort had there been her\n",
      "portion; aches, hurts, discouragements, and she the whole time being\n",
      "steadily unselfish. Now she had taken off all her goodness and left it\n",
      "behind her like a heap of rain-sodden clothes, and she only felt joy.\n",
      "She was naked of goodness, and was rejoicing in being naked. She was\n",
      "stripped, and exulting. And there, away in the dim mugginess of\n",
      "Hampstead, was Mellersh being angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to visualise Mellersh, she tried to see him having breakfast\n",
      "and thinking bitter things about her; and lo, Mellersh himself began to\n",
      "shimmer, became rose-colour, became delicate violet, became an\n",
      "enchanting blue, became formless, became iridescent. Actually Mellersh,\n",
      "after quivering a minute, was lost in light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, staring, as it were, after him. How\n",
      "extraordinary not to be able to visualise Mellersh; and she who used to\n",
      "know every feature, every expression of his by heart. She simply could\n",
      "not see him as he was. She could only see him resolved into beauty,\n",
      "melted into harmony with everything else. The familiar words of the\n",
      "General Thanksgiving came quite naturally into her mind, and she found\n",
      "herself blessing God for her creation, preservation, and all the\n",
      "blessings of this life, but above all for His inestimable Love; out\n",
      "loud; in a burst of acknowledgment. While Mellersh, at that moment\n",
      "angrily pulling on his boots before going out into the dripping\n",
      "streets, was indeed thinking bitter things about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began to dress, choosing clean white clothes in honour of the\n",
      "summer’s day, unpacking her suit-cases, tidying her adorable little\n",
      "room. She moved about with quick, purposeful steps, her long thin body\n",
      "held up straight, her small face, so much puckered at home with effort\n",
      "and fear, smoothed out. All she had been and done before this morning,\n",
      "all she had felt and worried about, was gone. Each of her worries\n",
      "behaved as the image of Mellersh had behaved, and dissolved into colour\n",
      "and light. And she noticed things she had not noticed for years—when\n",
      "she was doing her hair in front of the glass she noticed it, and\n",
      "thought, “Why, what pretty stuff.” For years she had forgotten she had\n",
      "such a thing as hair, plaiting it in the evening and unplaiting it in\n",
      "the morning with the same hurry and indifference with which she laced\n",
      "and unlaced her shoes. Now she suddenly saw it, and she twisted it\n",
      "round her fingers before the glass, and was glad it was so pretty.\n",
      "Mellersh couldn’t have seen it either, for he had never said a word\n",
      "about it. Well, when she got home she would draw his attention to it.\n",
      "“Mellersh,” she would say, “look at my hair. Aren’t you pleased you’ve\n",
      "got a wife with hair like curly honey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed. She had never said anything like that to Mellersh yet, and\n",
      "the idea of it amused her. But why had she not? Oh yes—she used to be\n",
      "afraid of him. Funny to be afraid of anybody; and especially of one’s\n",
      "husband, whom one saw in his more simplified moments, such as asleep,\n",
      "and not breathing properly through his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was ready she opened her door to go across to see if Rose, who\n",
      "had been put the night before by a sleepy maidservant into a cell\n",
      "opposite, were awake. She would say good-morning to her, and then she\n",
      "would run down and stay with that cypress tree till breakfast was\n",
      "ready, and after breakfast she wouldn’t so much as look out of a window\n",
      "till she had helped Rose get everything ready for Lady Caroline and\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher. There was much to be done that day, settling in, arranging\n",
      "the rooms; she mustn’t leave Rose to do it alone. They would make it\n",
      "all so lovely for the two to come, have such an entrancing vision ready\n",
      "for them of little cells bright with flowers. She remembered she had\n",
      "wanted Lady Caroline not to come; fancy wanting to shut some one out of\n",
      "heaven because she thought she would be shy of her! And as though it\n",
      "mattered if she were, and as though she would be anything so\n",
      "self-conscious as shy. Besides, what a reason. She could not accuse\n",
      "herself of goodness over that. And she remembered she had wanted not to\n",
      "have Mrs. Fisher either, because she had seemed lofty. How funny of\n",
      "her. So funny to worry about such little things, making them important.\n",

      "The bedrooms and two of the sitting-rooms at San Salvatore were on the\n",
      "top floor, and opened into a roomy hall with a wide glass window at the\n",

      "and on different levels. The garden this window looked down on was made\n",
      "on the highest part of the walls, and could only be reached through the\n",

      "out of her room this window stood wide open, and beyond it in the sun\n",
      "was a Judas tree in full flower. There was no sign of anybody, no sound\n",
      "of voices or feet. Tubs of arum lilies stood about on the stone floor,\n",
      "and on a table flamed a huge bunch of fierce nasturtiums. Spacious,\n",

      "her. Sometimes in the spring she had bought six tulips at Shoolbred’s,\n",
      "unable to resist them, conscious that Mellersh if he knew what they had\n",
      "cost would think it inexcusable; but they had soon died, and then there\n",
      "were no more. As for the Judas tree, she hadn’t an idea what it was,\n",
      "and gazed at it out there against the sky with the rapt expression of\n",
      "one who sees a heavenly vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot, coming out of her room, found her there like that,\n",
      "standing in the middle of the hall staring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now what does she think she sees now?” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to her, speaking\n",
      "with extreme conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said Mrs. Arbuthnot quickly, her face, which had been covered\n",
      "with smiles when she came out of her room, falling. “Why, what has\n",
      "happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mrs. Arbuthnot had woken up with such a delightful feeling of\n",
      "security, of relief, and she did not want to find she had not after all\n",
      "escaped from the need of refuge. She had not even dreamed of Frederick.\n",
      "For the first time for years she had been spared the nightly dream that\n",
      "he was with her, that they were heart to heart, and its miserable\n",
      "awakening. She had slept like a baby, and had woken up confident; she\n",
      "had found there was nothing she wished to say in her morning prayer\n",
      "except Thank you. It was disconcerting to be told she was after all in\n",
      "God’s hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope nothing has happened?” she asked anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins looked at her a moment, and laughed. “How funny,” she\n",
      "said, kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is funny?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, her face clearing because Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are. This is. Everything. It’s all so wonderful. It’s so funny and\n",
      "so adorable that we should be in it. I daresay when we finally reach\n",
      "heaven—the one they talk about so much—we shan’t find it a bit more\n",
      "beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot relaxed to smiling security again. “Isn’t it divine?”\n",
      "she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were you ever, ever in your life so happy?” asked Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "catching her by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Nor had she been; not ever; not even in her\n",
      "first love-days with Frederick. Because always pain had been close at\n",
      "hand in that other happiness, ready to torture with doubts, to torture\n",
      "even with the very excess of her love; while this was the simple\n",
      "happiness of complete harmony with her surroundings, the happiness that\n",
      "asks for nothing, that just accepts, just breathes, just is.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go and look at that tree close,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\n",
      "believe it can only be a tree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And arm in arm they went along the hall, and their husbands would not\n",
      "have known them their faces were so young with eagerness, and together\n",
      "they stood at the open window, and when their eyes, having feasted on\n",
      "the marvellous pink thing, wandered farther among the beauties of the\n",
      "garden, they saw sitting on the low wall at the east edge of it, gazing\n",
      "out over the bay, her feet in lilies, Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were astonished. They said nothing in their astonishment, but\n",
      "stood quite still, arm in arm, staring down at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She too had on a white frock, and her head was bare. They had had no\n",
      "idea that day in London, when her hat was down to her nose and her furs\n",
      "were up to her ears, that she was so pretty. They had merely thought\n",
      "her different from the other women in the club, and so had the other\n",
      "women themselves, and so had all the waitresses, eyeing her sideways\n",
      "and eyeing her again as they passed the corner where she sat talking;\n",
      "but they had had no idea she was so pretty. She was exceedingly pretty.\n",
      "Everything about her was very much that which it was. Her fair hair was\n",
      "very fair, her lovely grey eyes were very lovely and grey, her dark\n",
      "eyelashes were very dark, her white skin was very white, her red mouth\n",
      "was very red. She was extravagantly slender—the merest thread of a\n",
      "girl, though not without little curves beneath her thin frock where\n",
      "little curves should be. She was looking out across the bay, and was\n",
      "sharply defined against the background of empty blue. She was full in\n",
      "the sun. Her feet dangled among the leaves and flowers of the lilies\n",
      "just as if it did not matter that they should be bent or bruised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She ought to have a headache,” whispered Mrs. Arbuthnot at last,\n",
      "“sitting there in the sun like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She ought to have a hat,” whispered Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s treading on lilies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they’re hers as much as ours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one-fourth of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline turned her head. She looked up at them a moment,\n",
      "surprised to see them so much younger than they had seemed that day at\n",
      "the club, and so much less unattractive. Indeed, they were really\n",
      "almost quite attractive, if any one could ever be really quite\n",
      "attractive in the wrong clothes. Her eyes, swiftly glancing over them,\n",
      "took in every inch of each of them in the half second before she smiled\n",
      "and waved her hand and called out Good-morning. There was nothing, she\n",
      "saw at once, to be hoped for in the way of interest from their clothes.\n",
      "She did not consciously think this, for she was having a violent\n",
      "reaction against beautiful clothes and the slavery they impose on one,\n",
      "her experience being that the instant one had got them they took one in\n",
      "hand and gave one no peace till they had been everywhere and been seen\n",
      "by everybody. You didn’t take your clothes to parties; they took you.\n",
      "It was quite a mistake to think that a woman, a really well-dressed\n",
      "woman, wore out her clothes; it was the clothes that wore out the\n",
      "woman—dragging her about at all hours of the day and night. No wonder\n",
      "men stayed young longer. Just new trousers couldn’t excite them. She\n",
      "couldn’t suppose that even the newest trousers ever behaved like that,\n",
      "taking the bit between their teeth. Her images were disorderly, but she\n",
      "thought as she chose, she used what images she liked. As she got off the\n",
      "wall and came towards the window, it seemed a restful thing to know she\n",
      "was going to spend an entire month with people in dresses made as she\n",
      "dimly remembered dresses used to be made five summers ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I got here yesterday morning,” she said, looking up at them and\n",
      "smiling. She really was bewitching. She had everything, even a dimple.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a great pity,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling back, “because we\n",
      "were going to choose the nicest room for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but I’ve done that,” said Lady Caroline. “At least, I think it’s\n",
      "the nicest. It looks two ways—I adore a room that looks two ways, don’t\n",
      "you? Over the sea to the west, and over this Judas tree to the north.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we had meant to make it pretty for you with flowers,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Domenico did that. I told him to directly I got here. He’s the\n",
      "gardener. He’s wonderful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a good thing, of course,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot a little\n",
      "hesitatingly, “to be independent, and to know exactly what one wants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it saves trouble,” agreed Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But one shouldn’t be so independent,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “as to leave\n",
      "no opportunity for other people to exercise their benevolences on one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline, who had been looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot, now looked at\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins. That day at that queer club she had had merely a blurred\n",
      "impression of Mrs. Wilkins, for it was the other one who did all the\n",
      "talking, and her impression had been of somebody so shy, so awkward\n",
      "that it was best to take no notice of her. She had not even been able\n",
      "to say good-bye properly, doing it in an agony, turning red, turning\n",
      "damp. Therefore she now looked at her in some surprise; and she was\n",
      "still more surprised when Mrs. Wilkins added, gazing at her with the\n",
      "most obvious sincere admiration, speaking indeed with a conviction that\n",
      "refused to remain unuttered, “I didn’t realise you were so pretty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared at Mrs. Wilkins. She was not usually told this quite so\n",
      "immediately and roundly. Abundantly as she was used to it—impossible\n",
      "not to be after twenty-eight solid years—it surprised her to be told it\n",
      "with such bluntness, and by a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very kind of you to think so,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you’re lovely,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Quite, quite lovely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot pleasantly, “you make the most of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline then stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Oh yes,” she said. “I\n",
      "make the most of it. I’ve been doing that ever since I can remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling and raising a warning\n",
      "forefinger, “it won’t last.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Lady Caroline began to be afraid these two were originals. If so,\n",
      "she would be bored. Nothing bored her so much as people who insisted\n",
      "on being original, who came and buttonholed her and kept her waiting\n",
      "while they were being original. And the one who admired her—it would\n",
      "be tiresome if she dogged her about in order to look at her. What\n",
      "she wanted of this holiday was complete escape from all she had had\n",
      "before, she wanted the rest of complete contrast. Being admired, being\n",
      "dogged, wasn’t contrast, it was repetition; and as for originals, to\n",
      "find herself shut up with two on the top of a precipitous hill in a\n",
      "mediaeval castle built for the express purpose of preventing easy\n",
      "goings out and in, would not, she was afraid, be especially restful.\n",
      "Perhaps she had better be a little less encouraging. They had seemed\n",
      "such timid creatures, even the dark one—she couldn’t remember their\n",
      "names—that day at the club, that she had felt it quite safe to be very\n",
      "friendly. Here they had come out of their shells; already; indeed, at\n",
      "once. There was no sign of timidity about either of them here. If they\n",
      "had got out of their shells so immediately, at the very first contact,\n",
      "unless she checked them they would soon begin to press upon her, and\n",
      "then good-bye to her dream of thirty restful, silent days, lying\n",
      "unmolested in the sun, getting her feathers smooth again, not being\n",
      "spoken to, not waited on, not grabbed at and monopolised, but just\n",
      "recovering from the fatigue, the deep and melancholy fatigue, of the\n",
      "too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, there was Mrs. Fisher. She too must be checked. Lady Caroline\n",
      "had started two days earlier than had been arranged for two reasons:\n",
      "first, because she wished to arrive before the others in order to pick\n",
      "out the room or rooms she preferred, and second, because she judged it\n",
      "likely that otherwise she would have to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She\n",
      "did not want to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She did not want to arrive\n",
      "with Mrs. Fisher. She saw no reason whatever why for a single moment\n",
      "she should have to have anything at all to do with Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately Mrs. Fisher also was filled with a desire to get to\n",
      "San Salvatore first and pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and\n",
      "she and Lady Caroline had after all travelled together. As early as\n",
      "Calais they began to suspect it; in Paris they feared it; at Modane\n",
      "they knew it; at Mezzago they concealed it, driving out to Castagneto\n",
      "in two separate flys, the nose of the one almost touching the back of\n",
      "the other the whole way. But when the road suddenly left off at the\n",
      "church and the steps, further evasion was impossible; and faced by this\n",
      "abrupt and difficult finish to their journey there was nothing for it\n",
      "but to amalgamate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of Mrs. Fisher’s stick Lady Caroline had to see about\n",
      "everything. Mrs. Fisher’s intentions, she explained from her fly when\n",
      "the situation had become plain to her, were active, but her stick\n",
      "prevented their being carried out. The two drivers told Lady Caroline\n",
      "boys would have to carry the luggage up to the castle, and she went in\n",
      "search of some, while Mrs. Fisher waited in the fly because of her\n",
      "stick. Mrs. Fisher could speak Italian, but only, she explained, the\n",
      "Italian of Dante, which Matthew Arnold used to read with her when she\n",
      "was a girl, and she thought this might be above the heads of boys.\n",
      "Therefore Lady Caroline, who spoke ordinary Italian very well, was\n",
      "obviously the one to go and do things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in your hands,” said Mrs. Fisher, sitting firmly in her fly. “You\n",
      "must please regard me as merely an old woman with a stick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And presently, down the steps and cobbles to the piazza, and along the\n",
      "quay, and up the zigzag path, Lady Caroline found herself as much\n",
      "obliged to walk slowly with Mrs. Fisher as if she were her own\n",
      "grandmother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s my stick,” Mrs. Fisher complacently remarked at intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they rested at those bends of the zigzag path where seats\n",
      "were, and Lady Caroline, who would have liked to run on and get to the\n",
      "top quickly, was forced in common humanity to remain with Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "because of her stick, Mrs. Fisher told her how she had been on a zigzag\n",
      "path once with Tennyson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn’t his cricket wonderful?” said Lady Caroline absently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Tennyson,” said Mrs. Fisher, turning her head and observing her\n",
      "a moment over her spectacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn’t he?” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am speaking,” said Mrs. Fisher, “of Alfred.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it was a path, too,” Mrs. Fisher went on severely, “curiously like\n",
      "this. No eucalyptus tree, of course, but otherwise curiously like this.\n",
      "And at one of the bends he turned and said to me—I see him now turning\n",
      "and saying to me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Mrs. Fisher would have to be checked. And so would these two up at\n",
      "the window. She had better begin at once. She was sorry she had got off\n",
      "the wall. All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited\n",
      "till they came down and out into the garden to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she ignored Mrs. Arbuthnot’s remark and raised forefinger, and said\n",
      "with marked coldness—at least, she tried to make it sound marked—that\n",
      "she supposed they would be going to breakfast, and that she had had\n",
      "hers; but it was her fate that however coldly she sent forth her words\n",
      "they came out sounding quite warm and agreeable. That was because she\n",
      "had a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special\n",
      "formation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing\n",
      "whatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever\n",
      "believed they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she\n",
      "stared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to\n",
      "begin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark\n",
      "eyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught\n",
      "and lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely\n",
      "thought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite\n",
      "attentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely\n",
      "cross—and who would not be sometimes in such a world?—she only looked\n",
      "so pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means\n",
      "of kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was\n",
      "determined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be\n",
      "disagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had my breakfast in my room,” she said, trying her utmost to sound\n",
      "curt. “Perhaps I’ll see you later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she nodded, and went back to where she had been sitting on the\n",
      "wall, with the lilies being nice and cool round her feet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their eyes followed her admiringly. They had no idea they had been\n",
      "snubbed. It was a disappointment, of course, to find she had\n",
      "forestalled them and that they were not to have the happiness of\n",
      "preparing for her, of watching her face when she arrived and first saw\n",
      "everything, but there was still Mrs. Fisher. They would concentrate on\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, and would watch her face instead; only, like everybody\n",
      "else, they would have preferred to watch Lady Caroline’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, then, as Lady Caroline had talked of breakfast, they had\n",
      "better begin by going and having it, for there was too much to be done\n",
      "that day to spend any more time gazing at the scenery—servants to be\n",
      "interviewed, the house to be gone through and examined, and finally\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher’s room to be got ready and adorned.\n",
      "\n",
      "They waved their hands gaily at Lady Caroline, who seemed absorbed in\n",
      "what she saw and took no notice, and turning away found the maidservant\n",
      "of the night before had come up silently behind them in cloth slippers\n",
      "with string soles.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was Francesca, the elderly parlour-maid, who had been with the\n",
      "owner, he had said, for years, and whose presence made inventories\n",
      "unnecessary; and after wishing them good-morning and hoping they had\n",
      "slept well, she told them breakfast was ready in the dining-room on the\n",
      "floor below, and if they would follow her she would lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not understand a single word of the very many in which\n",
      "Francesca succeeded in clothing this simple information, but they\n",
      "followed her, for it at least was clear that they were to follow, and\n",
      "going down the stairs, and along the broad hall like the one above\n",
      "except for glass doors at the end instead of a window opening into the\n",
      "garden, they were shown into the dining-room; where, sitting at the\n",
      "head of the table having her breakfast, was Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time they exclaimed. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot exclaimed, though her\n",
      "exclamation was only “Oh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins exclaimed at greater length. “Why, but it’s like having\n",
      "the bread taken out of one’s mouth!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do,” said Mrs. Fisher. “I can’t get up because of my\n",
      "stick.” And she stretched out her hand across the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They advanced and shook it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had no idea you were here,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mrs. Fisher, resuming her breakfast. “Yes. I am here.” And\n",
      "with composure she removed the top of her egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a great disappointment,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “We had meant to give\n",
      "you such a welcome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the one, Mrs. Fisher remembered, briefly glancing at her, who\n",
      "when she came to Prince of Wales Terrace said she had seen Keats. She\n",
      "must be careful with this one—curb her from the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "She therefore ignored Mrs. Wilkins and said gravely, with a downward\n",
      "face of impenetrable calm bent on her egg, “Yes. I arrived yesterday\n",
      "with Lady Caroline.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s really dreadful,” said Mrs. Wilkins, exactly as if she had not\n",
      "been ignored. “There’s nobody left to get anything ready for now. I\n",
      "feel thwarted. I feel as if the bread had been taken out of my mouth\n",
      "just when I was going to be happy swallowing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where will you sit?” asked Mrs. Fisher of Mrs. Arbuthnot—markedly of\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot; the comparison with the bread seemed to her most\n",
      "unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank you—” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting down rather suddenly next\n",
      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were only two places she could sit down in, the places laid on\n",

      "in the condition of nerves and shyness she was in last time she saw\n",

      "through the two windows facing east across the bay, flooded the room,\n",
      "and there was an open door leading into the garden, and the garden was\n",
      "full of many lovely things, especially freesias.\n",

      "The delicate and delicious fragrance of the freesias came in through\n",
      "the door and floated round Mrs. Wilkins’s enraptured nostrils. Freesias\n",
      "in London were quite beyond her. Occasionally she went into a shop and\n",
      "asked what they cost, so as just to have an excuse for lifting up a\n",
      "bunch and smelling them, well knowing that it was something awful like\n",
      "a shilling for about three flowers. Here they were everywhere—bursting\n",
      "out of every corner and carpeting the rose beds. Imagine it—having\n",
      "freesias to pick in armsful if you wanted to, and with glorious\n",

      "were not the only ones she could turn to for support and countenance.\n",
      "Even if these young women—she had no grounds for believing the one\n",

      "delightful way of putting things—Fly-by-Nights, what could it possibly,\n",
      "or in any way matter to her? Let them fly by night if they wished. One\n",
      "was not sixty-five for nothing. In any case there would only be four\n",
      "weeks of it, at the end of which she would see no more of them. And in\n",
      "the meanwhile there were plenty of places where she could sit quietly\n",
      "away from them and remember. Also there was her own sitting-room, a\n",
      "charming room, all honey-coloured furniture and pictures, with windows\n",
      "to the sea towards Genoa, and a door opening on to the battlements. The\n",
      "house possessed two sitting-rooms, and she had explained to that pretty\n",
      "creature Lady Caroline—certainly a pretty creature, whatever else she\n",
      "was; Tennyson would have enjoyed taking her for blows on the downs—who\n",
      "had seemed inclined to appropriate the honey-coloured one, that she\n",
      "needed some little refuge entirely to herself because of her stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody wants to see an old woman hobbling about everywhere,” she had\n",
      "said. “I shall be quite content to spend much of my time by myself in\n",
      "here or sitting out on these convenient battlements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she had a very nice bedroom, too; it looked two ways, across the\n",
      "bay to the morning sun—she liked the morning sun—and onto the garden.\n",
      "There were only two of these bedrooms with cross-views in the house,\n",
      "she and Lady Caroline had discovered, and they were by far the airiest.\n",
      "They each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Caroline had had the\n",
      "extra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In\n",
      "this way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Caroline, indeed,\n",
      "had turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the\n",
      "bigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable\n",
      "chair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own\n",
      "sitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Caroline had\n",
      "thought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her\n",
      "own, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be\n",
      "used between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant\n",
      "room with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room’s\n",
      "shape—it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced\n",
      "through the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to\n",
      "look like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly\n",
      "Lady Caroline had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and\n",
      "if she, Mrs. Fisher, had been less firm would have installed herself in\n",
      "it. Which would have been absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smilingly making an attempt to convey to\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher that though she, Mrs. Fisher, might not be exactly a guest\n",
      "she certainly was not in the very least a hostess, “your room is\n",
      "comfortable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite,” said Mrs. Fisher. “Will you have some more coffee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you. Will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you. There were two beds in my bedroom, filling it up\n",
      "unnecessarily, and I had one taken out. It has made it much more\n",
      "convenient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh that’s why I’ve got two beds in my room!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "illuminated; the second bed in her little cell had seemed an unnatural\n",
      "and inappropriate object from the moment she saw it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I gave no directions,” said Mrs. Fisher, addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, “I\n",
      "merely asked Francesca to remove it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have two in my room as well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your second one must be Lady Caroline’s. She had hers removed too,”\n",
      "said Mrs. Fisher. “It seems foolish to have more beds in a room than\n",
      "there are occupiers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But we haven’t got any husbands here either,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "“and I don’t see any use in extra beds in one’s room if one hasn’t got\n",
      "husbands to put in them. Can’t we have them taken away too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beds,” said Mrs. Fisher coldly, “cannot be removed from one room after\n",
      "another. They must remain somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins’s remarks seemed to Mrs. Fisher persistently unfortunate.\n",
      "Each time she opened her mouth she said something best left unsaid.\n",
      "Loose talk about husbands had never in Mrs. Fisher’s circle been\n",
      "encouraged. In the ’eighties, when she chiefly flourished, husbands\n",
      "were taken seriously, as the only real obstacles to sin. Beds too, if\n",
      "they had to be mentioned, were approached with caution; and a decent\n",
      "reserve prevented them and husbands ever being spoken of in the same\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned more markedly than ever to Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Do let me give\n",
      "you a little more coffee,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you. But won’t you have some more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No indeed. I never have more than two cups at breakfast. Would you\n",
      "like an orange?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you. Would you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t eat fruit at breakfast. It is an American fashion which I\n",
      "am too old now to adopt. Have you had all you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite. Have you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher paused before replying. Was this a habit, this trick of\n",
      "answering a simple question with the same question? If so it must be\n",
      "curbed, for no one could live for four weeks in any real comfort with\n",
      "somebody who had a habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced at Mrs. Arbuthnot, and her parted hair and gentle brow\n",
      "reassured her. No; it was accident, not habit, that had produced those\n",
      "echoes. She could as soon imagine a dove having tiresome habits as Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot. Considering her, she thought what a splendid wife she would\n",
      "have been for poor Carlyle. So much better than that horrid clever\n",
      "Jane. She would have soothed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then shall we go?” she suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me help you up,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, all consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank you—I can manage perfectly. It’s only sometimes that my\n",
      "stick prevents me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher got up quite easily; Mrs. Arbuthnot had hovered over her\n",
      "for nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with\n",
      "them. “Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this\n",
      "beauty—” And she held out a big one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m going to see to my duties,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, moving\n",
      "towards the door. “You’ll forgive me for leaving you, won’t you,” she\n",
      "added politely to Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher moved towards the door too; quite easily; almost quickly;\n",

      "with Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What time would you like to have lunch?” Mrs. Arbuthnot asked her,\n",
      "trying to keep her head as at least a non-guest, if not precisely a\n",
      "hostess, above water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lunch,” said Mrs. Fisher, “is at half-past twelve.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“But it’s too wonderful,” Mrs. Wilkins finished for her from the\n",

      "duties, wandered out and down the worn stone steps and under the\n",
      "pergola into the lower garden, Mrs. Wilkins said to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\n",
      "seemed pensive, “Don’t you see that if somebody else does the ordering\n",
      "it frees us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot said she did see, but nevertheless she thought it rather\n",

      "“I love things to be taken out of my hands,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing to that for two reasons—first, because she\n",
      "was struck by the remarkable and growing calm of the hitherto\n",
      "incoherent and excited Lotty, and secondly because what she was looking\n",
      "at was so very beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "All down the stone steps on either side were periwinkles in full\n",
      "flower, and she could now see what it was that had caught at her the\n",
      "night before and brushed, wet and scented, across her face. It was\n",
      "wistaria. Wistaria and sunshine  she remembered the\n",
      "advertisement. Here indeed were both in profusion. The wistaria was\n",
      "tumbling over itself in its excess of life, its prodigality of\n",
      "flowering; and where the pergola ended the sun blazed on scarlet\n",
      "geraniums, bushes of them, and nasturtiums in great heaps, and\n",
      "marigolds so brilliant that they seemed to be burning, and red and pink\n",
      "snapdragons, all outdoing each other in bright, fierce colour. The\n",
      "ground behind these flaming things dropped away in terraces to the sea,\n",
      "each terrace a little orchard, where among the olives grew vines on\n",
      "trellises, and fig-trees, and peach-trees, and cherry-trees. The\n",
      "cherry-trees and peach-trees were in blossom—lovely showers of white\n",
      "and deep rose-colour among the trembling delicacy of the olives; the\n",
      "fig-leaves were just big enough to smell of figs, the vine-buds were\n",
      "only beginning to show. And beneath these trees were groups of blue and\n",
      "purple irises, and bushes of lavender, and grey, sharp cactuses, and\n",
      "the grass was thick with dandelions and daisies, and right down at the\n",
      "bottom was the sea. Colour seemed flung down anyhow, anywhere; every\n",
      "sort of colour, piled up in heaps, pouring along in rivers—the\n",
      "periwinkles looked exactly as if they were being poured down each side\n",
      "of the steps—and flowers that grow only in borders in England, proud\n",
      "flowers keeping themselves to themselves over there, such as the great\n",
      "blue irises and the lavender, were being jostled by small, shining\n",
      "common things like dandelions and daisies and the white bells of the\n",
      "wild onion, and only seemed the better and the more exuberant for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood looking at this crowd of loveliness, this happy jumble, in\n",
      "silence. No, it didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher did; not here; not in\n",
      "such beauty. Mrs. Arbuthnot’s discomposure melted out of her. In the\n",
      "warmth and light of what she was looking at, of what to her was a\n",
      "manifestation, an entirely new side of God, how could one be\n",
      "discomposed? If only Frederick were with her, seeing it too, seeing as\n",

      "resist the effects of perfect beauty. Before many days, perhaps only\n",

      "The idea of Mrs. Fisher bursting out into anything, she who seemed so\n",

      "there and had not come up and done it round her. She disliked jokes at\n",
      "all times, but in the morning she hated them; especially close up;\n",
      "especially crowding in her ears. She hoped the originals were on their\n",
      "way out for a walk, and not on their way back from one. They were\n",

      "waved back, and turning her eyes to the more distant mountains surveyed\n",
      "them carefully till the two, tired of waving, moved away along the path\n",
      "and turned the corner and disappeared.\n",

      "“Oh, but nobody helps anybody in heaven. That’s finished with. You\n",
      "don’t try to be, or do. You simply are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Mrs. Arbuthnot wouldn’t go into that—not here, not to-day. The\n",
      "vicar, she knew, would have called Lotty’s talk levity, if not\n",
      "profanity. How old he seemed from here; an old, old vicar.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the path, and clambered down the olive terraces, down and\n",
      "down, to where at the bottom the warm, sleepy sea heaved gently among\n",
      "the rocks. There a pine-tree grew close to the water, and they sat\n",
      "under it, and a few yards away was a fishing-boat lying motionless and\n",
      "green-bellied on the water. The ripples of the sea made little gurgling\n",
      "noises at their feet. They screwed up their eyes to be able to look\n",
      "into the blaze of light beyond the shade of their tree. The hot smell\n",
      "from the pine-needles and from the cushions of wild thyme that padded\n",
      "the spaces between the rocks, and sometimes a smell of pure honey from\n",
      "a clump of warm irises up behind them in the sun, puffed across their\n",
      "faces. Very soon Mrs. Wilkins took her shoes and stockings off, and let\n",
      "her feet hang in the water. After watching her a minute Mrs. Arbuthnot\n",
      "did the same. Their happiness was then complete. Their husbands would\n",
      "not have known them. They left off talking. They ceased to mention\n",
      "heaven. They were just cups of acceptance.\n",

      "Meanwhile Lady Caroline, on her wall, was considering her position. The\n",
      "garden on the top of the wall was a delicious garden, but its situation\n",
      "made it insecure and exposed to interruptions. At any moment the others\n",
      "might come and want to use it, because both the hall and the\n",
      "dining-room had doors opening straight into it. Perhaps, thought Lady\n",
      "Caroline, she could arrange that it should be solely hers. Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "had the battlements, delightful with flowers, and a watch-tower all to\n",
      "herself, besides having snatched the one really nice room in the house.\n",
      "There were plenty of places the originals could go to—she had herself\n",
      "seen at least two other little gardens, while the hill the castle stood\n",
      "on was itself a garden, with walks and seats. Why should not this one\n",
      "spot be kept exclusively for her? She liked it; she liked it best of\n",
      "all. It had the Judas tree and an umbrella pine, it had the freesias\n",
      "and the lilies, it had a tamarisk beginning to flush pink, it had the\n",
      "convenient low wall to sit on, it had from each of its three sides the\n",
      "most amazing views—to the east the bay and mountains, to the north the\n",
      "village across the tranquil clear green water of the little harbour and\n",
      "the hills dotted with white houses and orange groves, and to the west\n",
      "was the thin thread of land by which San Salvatore was tied to the\n",
      "mainland, and then the open sea and the coast line beyond Genoa\n",
      "reaching away into the blue dimness of France. Yes, she would say she\n",
      "wanted to have this entirely to herself. How obviously sensible if each\n",
      "of them had their own special place to sit in apart. It was essential\n",
      "to her comfort that she should be able to be apart, left alone, not\n",
      "talked to. The others ought to like it best too. Why herd? One had\n",
      "enough of that in England, with one’s relations and friends—oh, the\n",
      "numbers of them!—pressing on one continually. Having successfully\n",
      "escaped them for four weeks why continue, and with persons having no\n",
      "earthly claim on one, to herd?\n",
      "\n",
      "She lit a cigarette. She began to feel secure. Those two had gone for a\n",
      "walk. There was no sign of Mrs. Fisher. How very pleasant this was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody came out through the glass doors, just as she was drawing a\n",
      "deep breath of security. Surely it couldn’t be Mrs. Fisher, wanting to\n",
      "sit with her? Mrs. Fisher had her battlements. She ought to stay on\n",
      "them, having snatched them. It would be too tiresome if she wouldn’t,\n",
      "and wanted not only to have them and her sitting-room but to establish\n",
      "herself in this garden as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "No; it wasn’t Mrs. Fisher, it was the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "She frowned. Was she going to have to go on ordering the food? Surely\n",
      "one or other of those two waving women would do that now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cook, who had been waiting in increasing agitation in the kitchen,\n",
      "watching the clock getting nearer to lunch-time while she still was\n",
      "without knowledge of what lunch was to consist of, had gone at last to\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, who had immediately waved her away. She then wandered\n",
      "about the house seeking a mistress, any mistress, who would tell her\n",
      "what to cook, and finding none; and at last, directed by Francesca, who\n",
      "always knew where everybody was, came out to Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domenico had provided this cook. She was Costanza, the sister of that\n",
      "one of his cousins who kept a restaurant down on the piazza. She helped\n",
      "her brother in his cooking when she had no other job, and knew every\n",
      "sort of fat, mysterious Italian dish such as the workmen of Castagneto,\n",
      "who crowded the restaurant at midday, and the inhabitants of Mezzago\n",
      "when they came over on Sundays, loved to eat. She was a fleshless\n",
      "spinster of fifty, grey-haired, nimble, rich of speech, and thought\n",
      "Lady Caroline more beautiful than anyone she had ever seen; and so did\n",
      "Domenico; and so did the boy Giuseppe who helped Domenico and was,\n",
      "besides, his nephew; and so did the girl Angela who helped Francesca\n",
      "and was, besides, Domenico’s niece; and so did Francesca herself.\n",
      "Domenico and Francesca, the only two who had seen them, thought the two\n",
      "ladies who arrived last very beautiful, but compared to the fair young\n",
      "lady who arrived first they were as candles to the electric light that\n",
      "had lately been installed, and as the tin tubs in the bedrooms to the\n",
      "wonderful new bathroom their master had had arranged on his last visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline scowled at the cook. The scowl, as usual, was transformed\n",
      "on the way into what appeared to be an intent and beautiful gravity,\n",
      "and Costanza threw up her hands and took the saints aloud to witness\n",
      "that here was the very picture of the Mother of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline asked her crossly what she wanted, and Costanza’s head\n",
      "went on one side with delight at the sheer music of her voice. She\n",
      "said, after waiting a moment in case the music was going to continue,\n",
      "for she didn’t wish to miss any of it, that she wanted orders; she had\n",
      "been to the Signorina’s mother, but in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is not my mother,” repudiated Lady Caroline angrily; and her anger\n",
      "sounded like the regretful wail of a melodious orphan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza poured forth pity. She too, she explained, had no mother—\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline interrupted with the curt information that her mother was\n",
      "alive and in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza praised God and the saints that the young lady did not yet\n",
      "know what it was like to be without a mother. Quickly enough did\n",
      "misfortunes overtake one; no doubt the young lady already had a\n",
      "husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Lady Caroline icily. Worse than jokes in the morning did she\n",
      "hate the idea of husbands. And everybody was always trying to press\n",
      "them on her—all her relations, all her friends, all the evening papers.\n",
      "After all, she could only marry one, anyhow; but you would think from\n",
      "the way everybody talked, and especially those persons who wanted to be\n",
      "husbands, that she could marry at least a dozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her soft, pathetic “No” made Costanza, who was standing close to her,\n",
      "well with sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor little one,” said Costanza, moved actually to pat her\n",
      "encouragingly on the shoulder, “take hope. There is still time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For lunch,” said Lady Caroline freezingly, marvelling as she spoke\n",
      "that she should be patted, she who had taken so much trouble to come to\n",
      "a place, remote and hidden, where she could be sure that among other\n",
      "things of a like oppressive nature pattings also were not, “we will\n",
      "have—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza became business-like. She interrupted with suggestions, and\n",
      "her suggestions were all admirable and all expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline did not know they were expensive, and fell in with them\n",
      "at once. They sounded very nice. Every sort of young vegetables and\n",
      "fruits came into them, and much butter and a great deal of cream and\n",
      "incredible numbers of eggs. Costanza said enthusiastically at the end,\n",
      "as a tribute to this acquiescence, that of the many ladies and\n",
      "gentlemen she had worked for on temporary jobs such as this she\n",
      "preferred the English ladies and gentlemen. She more than preferred\n",
      "them—they roused devotion in her. For they knew what to order; they did\n",
      "not skimp; they refrained from grinding down the faces of the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this Lady Caroline concluded that she had been extravagant, and\n",
      "promptly countermanded the cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza’s face fell, for she had a cousin who had a cow, and the cream\n",
      "was to have come from them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And perhaps we had better not have chickens,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza’s face fell more, for her brother at the restaurant kept\n",
      "chickens in his back-yard, and many of them were ready for killing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Also do not order strawberries till I have consulted with the other\n",
      "ladies,” said Lady Caroline, remembering that it was only the first of\n",
      "April, and that perhaps people who lived in Hampstead might be poor;\n",
      "indeed, must be poor, or why live in Hampstead? “It is not I who am\n",
      "mistress here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it the old one?” asked Costanza, her face very long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which of the other two ladies is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neither,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Costanza’s smiles returned, for the young lady was having fun with\n",
      "her and making jokes. She told her so, in her friendly Italian way, and\n",
      "was genuinely delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never make jokes,” said Lady Caroline briefly. “You had better go,\n",
      "or lunch will certainly not be ready by half-past twelve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And these curt words came out sounding so sweet that Costanza felt as\n",
      "if kind compliments were being paid her, and forgot her disappointment\n",
      "about the cream and the chickens, and went away all gratitude and\n",
      "smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” thought Lady Caroline, “will never do. I haven’t come here to\n",
      "housekeep, and I won’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She called Costanza back. Costanza came running. The sound of her name\n",
      "in that voice enchanted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have ordered the lunch for to-day,” said Lady Caroline, with the\n",
      "serious angel face that was hers when she was annoyed, “and I have also\n",
      "ordered the dinner, but from now on you will go to one of the other\n",
      "ladies for orders. I give no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea that she would go on giving orders was too absurd. She never\n",
      "gave orders at home. Nobody there dreamed of asking her to do anything.\n",
      "That such a very tiresome activity should be thrust upon her here,\n",
      "simply because she happened to be able to talk Italian, was ridiculous.\n",
      "Let the originals give orders if Mrs. Fisher refused to. Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "of course, was the one Nature intended for such a purpose. She had the\n",
      "very air of a competent housekeeper. Her clothes were the clothes of a\n",
      "housekeeper, and so was the way she did her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having delivered herself of her ultimatum with an acerbity that turned\n",
      "sweet on the way, and accompanied it by a peremptory gesture of\n",
      "dismissal that had the grace and loving-kindness of a benediction, it\n",
      "was annoying that Costanza should only stand still with her head on one\n",
      "side gazing at her in obvious delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, go away!” exclaimed Lady Caroline in English, suddenly\n",
      "exasperated.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been a fly in her bedroom that morning which had stuck just\n",
      "as Costanza was sticking; only one, but it might have been a myriad it\n",
      "was so tiresome from daylight on. It was determined to settle on her\n",
      "face, and she was determined it should not. Its persistence was\n",
      "uncanny. It woke her, and would not let her go to sleep again. She hit\n",
      "at it, and it eluded her without fuss or effort and with an almost\n",
      "visible blandness, and she had only hit herself. It came back again\n",
      "instantly, and with a loud buzz alighted on her cheek. She hit at it\n",
      "again and hurt herself, while it skimmed gracefully away. She lost her\n",
      "temper, and sat up in bed and waited, watching to hit at it and kill\n",
      "it. She kept on hitting at it at last with fury and with all her\n",
      "strength, as if it were a real enemy deliberately trying to madden her;\n",
      "and it elegantly skimmed in and out of her blows, not even angry, to be\n",
      "back again the next instant. It succeeded every time in getting on to\n",
      "her face, and was quite indifferent how often it was driven away. That\n",
      "was why she had dressed and come out so early. Francesca had already\n",
      "been told to put a net over her bed, for she was not going to allow\n",
      "herself to be annoyed twice like that. People were exactly like flies.\n",
      "She wished there were nets for keeping them off too. She hit at them\n",
      "with words and frowns, and like the fly they slipped between her blows\n",
      "and were untouched. Worse than the fly, they seemed unaware that she\n",
      "had even tried to hit them. The fly at least did for a moment go away.\n",
      "With human beings the only way to get rid of them was to go away\n",
      "herself. That was what, so tired, she had done this April; and having\n",
      "got here, having got close up to the details of life at San Salvatore,\n",
      "it appeared that here, too, she was not to be let alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viewed from London there had seemed to be no details. San Salvatore\n",
      "from there seemed to be an empty, a delicious blank. Yet, after only\n",
      "twenty-four hours of it, she was discovering that it was not a blank at\n",
      "all, and that she was having to ward off as actively as ever. Already\n",
      "she had been much stuck to. Mrs. Fisher had stuck nearly the whole of\n",
      "the day before, and this morning there had been no peace, not ten\n",
      "minutes uninterruptedly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza of course had finally to go because she had to cook, but\n",
      "hardly had she gone before Domenico came. He came to water and tie up.\n",
      "That was natural, since he was the gardener, but he watered and tied up\n",
      "all the things that were nearest to her; he hovered closer and closer;\n",
      "he watered to excess; he tied plants that were as straight and steady\n",
      "as arrows. Well, at least he was a man, and therefore not quite so\n",
      "annoying, and his smiling good-morning was received with an answering\n",
      "smile; upon which Domenico forgot his family, his wife, his mother, his\n",
      "grown-up children and all his duties, and only wanted to kiss the young\n",
      "lady’s feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not do that, unfortunately, but he could talk while he worked,\n",
      "and talk he did; voluminously; pouring out every kind of information,\n",
      "illustrating what he said with gestures so lively that he had to put\n",
      "down the watering-pot, and thus delay the end of the watering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline bore it for a time but presently was unable to bear it,\n",
      "and as he would not go, and she could not tell him to, seeing that he\n",
      "was engaged in his proper work, once again it was she who had to.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got off the wall and moved to the other side of the garden, where\n",
      "in a wooden shed were some comfortable low cane chairs. All she wanted\n",
      "was to turn one of these round with its back to Domenico and its front\n",
      "to the sea towards Genoa. Such a little thing to want. One would have\n",
      "thought she might have been allowed to do that unmolested. But he, who\n",
      "watched her every movement, when he saw her approaching the chairs\n",
      "darted after her and seized one and asked to be told where to put it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would she never get away from being waited on, being made comfortable,\n",
      "being asked where she wanted things put, having to say thank you? She\n",
      "was short with Domenico, who instantly concluded the sun had given her\n",
      "a headache, and ran in and fetched her a sunshade and a cushion and a\n",
      "footstool, and was skilful, and was wonderful, and was one of Nature’s\n",
      "gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shut her eyes in a heavy resignation. She could not be unkind to\n",
      "Domenico. She could not get up and walk indoors as she would have done\n",
      "if it had been one of the others. Domenico was intelligent and very\n",
      "competent. She had at once discovered that it was he who really ran the\n",
      "house, who really did everything. And his manners were definitely\n",
      "delightful, and he undoubtedly was a charming person. It was only that\n",
      "she did so much long to be let alone. If only, only she could be left\n",
      "quite quiet for this one month, she felt that she might perhaps make\n",
      "something of herself after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kept her eyes shut, because then he would think she wanted to sleep\n",
      "and would go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domenico’s romantic Italian soul melted within him at the sight, for\n",
      "having her eyes shut was extraordinarily becoming to her. He stood\n",
      "entranced, quite still, and she thought he had stolen away, so she\n",
      "opened them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "No; there he was, staring at her. Even he. There was no getting away\n",
      "from being stared at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a headache,” she said, shutting them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the sun,” said Domenico, “and sitting on the wall without a\n",
      "hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish to sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sì signorina,” he said sympathetically; and went softly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened her eyes with a sigh of relief. The gentle closing of the\n",
      "glass doors showed her that he had not only gone quite away but had\n",
      "shut her out in the garden so that she should be undisturbed. Now\n",
      "perhaps she would be alone till lunch-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very curious, and no one in the world could have been more\n",
      "surprised than she herself, but she wanted to think. She had never\n",
      "wanted to do that before. Everything else that it is possible to do\n",
      "without too much inconvenience she had either wanted to do or had done\n",
      "at one period or another of her life, but not before had she wanted to\n",
      "think. She had come to San Salvatore with the single intention of lying\n",
      "comatose for four weeks in the sun, somewhere where her parents and\n",
      "friends were not, lapped in forgetfulness, stirring herself only to be\n",
      "fed, and she had not been there more than a few hours when this strange\n",
      "new desire took hold of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been wonderful stars the evening before, and she had gone out\n",
      "into the top garden after dinner, leaving Mrs. Fisher alone over her\n",
      "nuts and wine, and, sitting on the wall at the place where the lilies\n",
      "crowded their ghost heads, she had looked out into the gulf of the\n",
      "night, and it had suddenly seemed as if her life had been a noise all\n",
      "about nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been intensely surprised. She knew stars and darkness did\n",
      "produce unusual emotions because, in others, she had seen them being\n",
      "produced, but they had not before done it in herself. A noise all about\n",
      "nothing. Could she be quite well? She had wondered. For a long while\n",
      "past she had been aware that her life was a noise, but it had seemed to\n",
      "be very much about something; a noise, indeed, about so much that she\n",
      "felt she must get out of earshot for a little or she would be\n",
      "completely, and perhaps permanently, deafened. But suppose it was only\n",
      "a noise about nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not had a question like that in her mind before. It had made\n",
      "her feel lonely. She wanted to be alone, but not lonely. That was very\n",
      "different; that was something that ached and hurt dreadfully right\n",
      "inside one. It was what one dreaded most. It was what made one go to so\n",
      "many parties; and lately even the parties had seemed once or twice not\n",
      "to be a perfectly certain protection. Was it possible that loneliness\n",
      "had nothing to do with circumstances, but only with the way one met\n",
      "them? Perhaps, she had thought, she had better go to bed. She couldn’t\n",
      "be very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went to bed; and in the morning, after she had escaped the fly and\n",
      "had her breakfast and got out again into the garden, there was this\n",
      "same feeling again, and in broad daylight. Once more she had that\n",
      "really rather disgusting suspicion that her life till now had not only\n",

      "That one of the two sitting-rooms which Mrs. Fisher had taken for her\n",
      "own was a room of charm and character. She surveyed it with\n",
      "satisfaction on going into it after breakfast, and was glad it was\n",
      "hers. It had a tiled floor, and walls the colour of pale honey, and\n",
      "inlaid furniture the colour of amber, and mellow books, many in ivory\n",
      "or lemon-coloured covers. There was a big window overlooking the sea\n",
      "towards Genoa, and a glass door through which she could proceed out on\n",
      "to the battlements and walk along past the quaint and attractive\n",
      "watch-tower, in itself a room with chairs and a writing table, to where\n",
      "on the other side of the tower the battlements ended in a marble seat,\n",
      "and one could see the western bay and the point round which began the\n",
      "Gulf of Spezia. Her south view, between these two stretches of sea, was\n",
      "another hill, higher than San Salvatore, the last of the little\n",
      "peninsula, with the bland turrets of a smaller and uninhabited castle\n",
      "on the top, on which the setting sun still shone when everything else\n",
      "was sunk in shadow. Yes, she was very comfortably established here; and\n",
      "receptacles—Mrs. Fisher did not examine their nature closely, but they\n",
      "seemed to be small stone troughs, or perhaps little sarcophagi—ringed\n",
      "round the battlements with flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These battlements, she thought, considering them, would have been a\n",
      "perfect place for her to pace up and down gently in moments when she\n",
      "least felt the need of her stick, or to sit in on the marble seat,\n",
      "having first put a cushion on it, if there had not unfortunately been a\n",
      "second glass door opening on to them, destroying their complete\n",
      "privacy, spoiling her feeling that the place was only for her. The\n",
      "second door belonged to the round drawing-room, which both she and Lady\n",
      "Caroline had rejected as too dark. That room would probably be sat in\n",
      "by the women from Hampstead, and she was afraid they would not confine\n",
      "themselves to sitting in it, but would come out through the glass door\n",
      "and invade her battlements. This would ruin the battlements. It would\n",
      "ruin them as far as she was concerned if they were to be overrun; or\n",
      "even if, not actually overrun, they were liable to be raked by the eyes\n",
      "of persons inside the room. No one could be perfectly at ease if they\n",
      "were being watched and knew it. What she wanted, what she surely had a\n",
      "right to, was privacy. She had no wish to intrude on the others; why\n",
      "then should they intrude on her? And she could always relax her privacy\n",
      "if, when she became better acquainted with her companions, she should\n",
      "think it worth while, but she doubted whether any of the three would so\n",
      "develop as to make her think it worth while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly anything was really worth while, reflected Mrs. Fisher, except\n",
      "the past. It was astonishing, it was simply amazing, the superiority of\n",
      "the past to the present. Those friends of hers in London, solid persons\n",
      "of her own age, knew the same past that she knew, could talk about it\n",
      "with her, could compare it as she did with the tinkling present, and in\n",
      "remembering great men forget for a moment the trivial and barren young\n",
      "people who still, in spite of the war, seemed to litter the world in\n",
      "such numbers. She had not come away from these friends, these\n",
      "conversable ripe friends, in order to spend her time in Italy chatting\n",
      "with three persons of another generation and defective experience; she\n",
      "had come away merely to avoid the treacheries of a London April. It was\n",
      "true what she had told the two who came to Prince of Wales Terrace,\n",
      "that all she wished to do at San Salvatore was to sit by herself in the\n",
      "sun and remember. They knew this, for she had told them. It had been\n",
      "plainly expressed and clearly understood. Therefore she had a right to\n",
      "expect them to stay inside the round drawing-room and not to emerge\n",
      "interruptingly on to her battlements.\n",
      "\n",
      "But would they? The doubt spoilt her morning. It was only towards\n",
      "lunch-time that she saw a way to be quite safe, and ringing for\n",
      "Francesca, bade her, in slow and majestic Italian, shut the shutters of\n",
      "the glass door of the round drawing-room, and then, going with her into\n",
      "the room, which had become darker than ever in consequence, but also,\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher observed to Francesca, who was being voluble, would because\n",
      "of this very darkness remain agreeably cool, and after all there were\n",
      "the numerous slit-windows in the walls to let in light and it was\n",
      "nothing to do with her if they did not let it in, she directed the\n",
      "placing of a cabinet of curios across the door on its inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would discourage egress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she rang for Domenico, and caused him to move one of the\n",
      "flower-filled sarcophagi across the door on its outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would discourage ingress.\n",
      "\n",

      "could look straight on to them, gazed at her battlements, secured to\n",
      "her now completely, with calm pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being here, she reflected placidly, was much cheaper than being in an\n",
      "hotel and, if she could keep off the others, immeasurably more\n",
      "agreeable. She was paying for her rooms—extremely pleasant rooms, now\n",
      "that she was arranged in them—£3 a week, which came to about eight\n",
      "shillings a day, battlements, watch-tower and all. Where else abroad\n",
      "could she live as well for so little, and have as many baths as she\n",
      "liked, for eight shillings a day? Of course she did not yet know what\n",
      "her food would cost, but she would insist on carefulness over that,\n",
      "though she would also insist on its being carefulness combined with\n",
      "excellence. The two were perfectly compatible if the caterer took\n",
      "pains. The servants’ wages, she had ascertained, were negligible, owing\n",
      "to the advantageous exchange, so that there was only the food to cause\n",
      "her anxiety. If she saw signs of extravagance she would propose that\n",
      "they each hand over a reasonable sum every week to Lady Caroline which\n",
      "should cover the bills, any of it that was not used to be returned, and\n",
      "if it were exceeded the loss to be borne by the caterer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher was well off and had the desire for comforts proper to her\n",
      "age, but she disliked expenses. So well off was she that, had she so\n",
      "chosen, she could have lived in an opulent part of London and driven\n",
      "from it and to it in a Rolls-Royce. She had no such wish. It needed\n",
      "more vitality than went with true comfort to deal with a house in an\n",
      "opulent spot and a Rolls-Royce. Worries attended such possessions,\n",
      "worries of every kind, crowned by bills. In the sober gloom of Prince\n",
      "of Wales Terrace she could obscurely enjoy inexpensive yet real\n",
      "comfort, without being snatched at by predatory men-servants or\n",
      "collectors for charities, and a taxi stand was at the end of the road.\n",
      "Her annual outlay was small. The house was inherited. Death had\n",
      "furnished it for her. She trod in the dining-room on the Turkey carpet\n",
      "of her fathers; she regulated her day by the excellent black marble\n",
      "clock on the mantelpiece which she remembered from childhood; her walls\n",
      "were entirely covered by the photographs her illustrious deceased\n",
      "friends had given either herself or her father, with their own\n",
      "handwriting across the lower parts of their bodies, and the windows,\n",
      "shrouded by the maroon curtains of all her life, were decorated besides\n",
      "with the selfsame aquariums to which she owed her first lessons in\n",
      "sealore, and in which still swam slowly the goldfishes of her youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were they the same goldfish? She did not know. Perhaps, like carp, they\n",

      "as the years went by withdrawn and replaced themselves. Were they or\n",
      "were they not, she sometimes wondered, contemplating them between the\n",
      "courses of her solitary meals, the same goldfish that had that day been\n",
      "there when Carlyle—how well she remembered it—angrily strode up to them\n",
      "in the middle of some argument with her father that had grown heated,\n",
      "and striking the glass smartly with his fist had put them to flight,\n",
      "shouting as they fled, “Och, ye deaf deevils! Och, ye lucky deaf\n",
      "deevils! Ye can’t hear anything of the blasted, blethering, doddering,\n",
      "glaikit fool-stuff yer maister talks, can ye?” Or words to that effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear, great-souled Carlyle. Such natural gushings forth; such true\n",
      "freshness; such real grandeur. Rugged, if you will—yes, undoubtedly\n",
      "sometimes rugged, and startling in a drawing-room, but magnificent. Who\n",
      "was there now to put beside him? Who was there to mention in the same\n",
      "breath? Her father, than whom no one had had more flair, said:\n",
      "“Thomas is immortal.” And here was this generation, this generation of\n",
      "puniness, raising its little voice in doubts, or, still worse, not\n",
      "giving itself the trouble to raise it at all, not—it was incredible,\n",
      "but it had been thus reported to her—even reading him. Mrs. Fisher did\n",
      "not read him either, but that was different. She had read him; she had\n",
      "certainly read him. Of course she had read him. There was\n",
      "Teufelsdröck—she quite well remembered a tailor called Teufelsdröck. So\n",
      "like Carlyle to call him that. Yes, she must have read him, though\n",
      "naturally details escaped her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gong sounded. Lost in reminiscence Mrs. Fisher had forgotten time,\n",
      "and hastened to her bedroom to wash her hands and smoothe her hair. She\n",
      "did not wish to be late and set a bad example, and perhaps find her\n",
      "seat at the head of the table taken. One could put no trust in the\n",
      "manners of the younger generation; especially not in those of that Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins.\n",

      "She was, however, the first to arrive in the dining-room. Francesca in\n",

      "glistening maccaroni, but nobody was there to eat it.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Serve me,” she said to Francesca, who showed a disposition to wait for\n",
      "the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francesca served her. Of the party she liked Mrs. Fisher least, in fact\n",
      "she did not like her at all. She was the only one of the four ladies\n",
      "who had not yet smiled. True she was old, true she was unbeautiful,\n",
      "true she therefore had no reason to smile, but kind ladies smiled,\n",
      "reason or no. They smiled, not because they were happy but because they\n",
      "wished to make happy. This one of the four ladies could not then,\n",
      "Francesca decided, be kind; so she handed her the maccaroni, being\n",
      "unable to hide any of her feelings, morosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very well cooked, but Mrs. Fisher had never cared for maccaroni,\n",
      "especially not this long, worm-shaped variety. She found it difficult\n",
      "to eat—slippery, wriggling off her fork, making her look, she felt,\n",
      "undignified when, having got it as she supposed into her mouth, ends of\n",
      "it yet hung out. Always, too, when she ate it she was reminded of Mr.\n",
      "Fisher. He had during their married life behaved very much like\n",
      "maccaroni. He had slipped, he had wriggled, he had made her feel\n",
      "undignified, and when at last she had got him safe, as she thought,\n",
      "there had invariably been little bits of him that still, as it were,\n",
      "hung out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francesca from the sideboard watched Mrs. Fisher’s way with maccaroni\n",
      "gloomily, and her gloom deepened when she saw her at last take her\n",
      "knife to it and chop it small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher really did not know how else to get hold of the stuff. She\n",
      "was aware that knives in this connection were improper, but one did\n",
      "finally lose patience. Maccaroni was never allowed to appear on her\n",
      "table in London. Apart from its tiresomeness she did not even like it,\n",
      "and she would tell Lady Caroline not to order it again. Years of\n",
      "practice, reflected Mrs. Fisher, chopping it up, years of actual living\n",
      "in Italy, would be necessary to learn the exact trick. Browning managed\n",
      "maccaroni wonderfully. She remembered watching him one day when he came\n",
      "to lunch with her father, and a dish of it had been ordered as a\n",
      "compliment to his connection with Italy. Fascinating, the way it went\n",
      "in. No chasing round the plate, no slidings off the fork, no subsequent\n",
      "protrusions of loose ends—just one dig, one whisk, one thrust, one\n",
      "gulp, and lo, yet another poet had been nourished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall I go and seek the young lady?” asked Francesca, unable any\n",
      "longer to look on a good maccaroni being cut with a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher came out of her reminiscent reflections with difficulty.\n",
      "“She knows lunch is at half-past twelve,” she said. “They all know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She may be asleep,” said Francesca. “The other ladies are further\n",
      "away, but this one is not far away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beat the gong again then,” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "What manners, she thought; what, what manners. It was not an hotel, and\n",
      "considerations were due. She must say she was surprised at Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, who had not looked like somebody unpunctual. Lady Caroline,\n",
      "too—she had seemed amiable and courteous, whatever else she might be.\n",
      "From the other one, of course, she expected nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francesca fetched the gong, and took it out into the garden and\n",
      "advanced, beating it as she advanced, close up to Lady Caroline, who,\n",
      "still stretched in her low chair, waited till she had done, and then\n",
      "turned her head and in the sweetest tones poured forth what appeared to\n",
      "be music but was really invective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francesca did not recognise the liquid flow as invective; how was she\n",
      "to, when it came out sounding like that? And with her face all smiles,\n",
      "for she could not but smile when she looked at this young lady, she\n",
      "told her the maccaroni was getting cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I do not come to meals it is because I do not wish to come to\n",
      "meals,” said the irritated Scrap, “and you will not in future disturb\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she ill?” asked Francesca, sympathetic but unable to stop smiling.\n",
      "Never, never had she seen hair so beautiful. Like pure flax; like the\n",
      "hair of northern babes. On such a little head only blessing could rest,\n",
      "on such a little head the nimbus of the holiest saints could fitly be\n",
      "placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap shut her eyes and refused to answer. In this she was injudicious,\n",
      "for its effect was to convince Francesca, who hurried away full of\n",
      "concern to tell Mrs. Fisher, that she was indisposed. And Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "being prevented, she explained, from going out to Lady Caroline herself\n",
      "because of her stick, sent the two others instead, who had come in at\n",
      "that moment heated and breathless and full of excuses, while she\n",
      "herself proceeded to the next course, which was a very well-made\n",
      "omelette, bursting most agreeably at both its ends with young green\n",
      "peas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serve me,” she directed Francesca, who again showed a disposition to\n",
      "wait for the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, why won’t they leave me alone?—oh, why won’t they leave me\n",
      "alone?” Scrap asked herself when she heard more scrunchings on the\n",
      "little pebbles which took the place of grass, and therefore knew some\n",
      "one else was approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kept her eyes tight shut this time. Why should she go in to lunch\n",
      "if she didn’t want to? This wasn’t a private house; she was in no way\n",
      "tangled up in duties towards a tiresome hostess. For all practical\n",
      "purposes San Salvatore was an hotel, and she ought to be let alone to\n",
      "eat or not to eat exactly as if she really had been in an hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the unfortunate Scrap could not just sit still and close her eyes\n",
      "without rousing that desire to stroke and pet in her beholders with\n",
      "which she was only too familiar. Even the cook had patted her. And now\n",
      "a gentle hand—how well she knew and how much she dreaded gentle\n",
      "hands—was placed on her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid you’re not well,” said a voice that was not Mrs. Fisher’s,\n",
      "and therefore must belong to one of the originals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a headache,” murmured Scrap. Perhaps it was best to say that;\n",
      "perhaps it was the shortest cut to peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m so sorry,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot softly, for it was her hand being\n",
      "gentle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I,” said Scrap to herself, “who thought if I came here I would\n",
      "escape mothers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you think some tea would do you good?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot\n",
      "tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea? The idea was abhorrent to Scrap. In this heat to be drinking tea\n",
      "in the middle of the day\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I expect what would really be best for her,” said another voice, “is\n",
      "to be left quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How sensible, thought Scrap; and raised the eye-lashes of one eye just\n",
      "enough to peep through and see who was speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the freckled original. The dark one, then, was the one with the\n",
      "hand. The freckled one rose in her esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I can’t bear to think of you with a headache and nothing being\n",
      "done for it,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Would a cup of strong black\n",
      "coffee—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap said no more. She waited, motionless and dumb, till Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot should remove her hand. After all, she couldn’t stand there\n",
      "all day, and when she went away she would have to take her hand with\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do think,” said the freckled one, “that she wants nothing except\n",
      "quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps the freckled one pulled the one with the hand by the\n",
      "sleeve, for the hold on Scrap’s forehead relaxed, and after a minute’s\n",
      "silence, during which no doubt she was being contemplated—she was\n",
      "always being contemplated—the footsteps began to scrunch the pebbles\n",
      "again, and grew fainter, and were gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lady Caroline has a headache,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, re-entering the\n",
      "dining-room and sitting down in her place next to Mrs. Fisher. “I can’t\n",
      "persuade her to have even a little tea, or some black coffee. Do you\n",
      "know what aspirin is in Italian?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The proper remedy for headaches,” said Mrs. Fisher firmly, “is castor\n",

      "applauded, listened to, petted, adored wherever she went, and when she\n",
      "came home to find nothing there either but the most indulgent proud\n",

      "things with friends was pleasant she could understand that Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "still steeped in the Prince of Wales Terrace attitude to life, did not\n",
      "yet want to, but that she would get rid of that after a bit and feel\n",
      "quite different. “Soon you’ll want us to share,” said Mrs. Wilkins\n",
      "reassuringly. “Why, you may even get so far as asking me to use your\n",
      "pen if you knew I hadn’t got one.”\n",

      "were, in breezy certitude that quite soon she would improve, stirred\n",
      "her more deeply than anything had stirred her since her first discovery\n",
      "that Mr. Fisher was not what he seemed. Mrs. Wilkins must certainly be\n",
      "curbed. But how? There was a curious imperviousness about her. At that\n",
      "moment, for instance, she was smiling as pleasantly and with as\n",
      "unclouded a face as if she were saying nothing in the least\n",
      "impertinent. Would she know she was being curbed? If she didn’t know,\n",
      "if she were too tough to feel it, then what? Nothing, except avoidance;\n",
      "except, precisely, one’s own private sitting-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m an old woman,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and I need a room to myself. I\n",
      "cannot get about, because of my stick. As I cannot get about I have to\n",
      "sit. Why should I not sit quietly and undisturbed, as I told you in\n",
      "London I intended to? If people are to come in and out all day long,\n",
      "chattering and leaving doors open, you will have broken the agreement,\n",
      "which was that I was to be quiet.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“We’re only too glad,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “for you to have this room if\n",
      "it makes you happy. We didn’t know about it, that’s all. We wouldn’t\n",
      "have come in if we had—not till you invited us, anyhow. I expect,” she\n",
      "finished looking down cheerfully at Mrs. Fisher, “you soon will.” And\n",
      "picking up her letter she took Mrs. Arbuthnot’s hand and drew her\n",
      "towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot did not want to go. She, the mildest of women, was\n",
      "filled with a curious and surely unchristian desire to stay and fight.\n",
      "Not, of course, really, nor even with any definitely aggressive words.\n",
      "No; she only wanted to reason with Mrs. Fisher, and to reason\n",
      "patiently. But she did feel that something ought to be said, and that\n",
      "she ought not to allow herself to be rated and turned out as if she\n",
      "were a schoolgirl caught in ill behaviour by Authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, however, drew her firmly to and through the door, and\n",
      "once again Rose wondered at Lotty, at her balance, her sweet and\n",
      "equable temper—she who in England had been such a thing of gusts. From\n",
      "the moment they got into Italy it was Lotty who seemed the elder. She\n",
      "certainly was very happy; blissful, in fact. Did happiness so\n",
      "completely protect one? Did it make one so untouchable, so wise? Rose\n",
      "was happy herself, but not anything like so happy. Evidently not, for\n",
      "not only did she want to fight Mrs. Fisher but she wanted something\n",
      "else, something more than this lovely place, something to complete it;\n",
      "she wanted Frederick. For the first time in her life she was surrounded\n",
      "by perfect beauty, and her one thought was to show it to him, to share\n",
      "it with him. She wanted Frederick. She yearned for Frederick. Ah, if\n",
      "only, only Frederick \n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor old thing,” said Mrs. Wilkins, shutting the door gently on Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher and her triumph. “Fancy on a day like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s a very rude old thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’ll get over that. I’m sorry we chose just her room to go and sit\n",
      "in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s much the nicest,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “And it isn’t hers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh but there are lots of other places, and she’s such a poor old\n",
      "thing. Let her have the room. Whatever does it matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mrs. Wilkins said she was going down to the village to find out\n",
      "where the post-office was and post her letter to Mellersh, and would\n",
      "Rose go too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins as they walked,\n",
      "one behind the other, down the narrow zigzag path up which they had\n",
      "climbed in the rain the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went first. Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite naturally now, followed. In\n",
      "England it had been the other way about—Lotty, timid, hesitating,\n",
      "except when she burst out so awkwardly, getting behind the calm and\n",
      "reasonable Rose whenever she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins over her\n",
      "shoulder, as Rose seemed not to have heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you?” said Rose, a faint distaste in her voice, for her\n",
      "experiences with Mellersh had not been of a kind to make her enjoy\n",
      "remembering him. She had deceived Mellersh; therefore she didn’t like\n",
      "him. She was unconscious that this was the reason of her dislike, and\n",
      "thought it was that there didn’t seem to be much, if any, of the grace\n",
      "of God about him. And yet how wrong to feel that, she rebuked herself,\n",
      "and how presumptuous. No doubt Lotty’s husband was far, far nearer to\n",
      "God than she herself was ever likely to be. Still, she didn’t like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been a mean dog,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A what?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, incredulous of her hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All this coming away and leaving him in that dreary place while I\n",
      "rollick in heaven. He had planned to take me to Italy for Easter\n",
      "himself. Did I tell you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot; and indeed she had discouraged talk about\n",
      "husbands. Whenever Lotty had begun to blurt out things she had swiftly\n",
      "changed the conversation. One husband led to another, in conversation\n",
      "as well as in life, she felt, and she could not, she would not, talk of\n",
      "Frederick. Beyond the bare fact that he was there, he had not been\n",
      "mentioned. Mellersh had had to be mentioned, because of his\n",
      "obstructiveness, but she had carefully kept him from overflowing\n",
      "outside the limits of necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he did,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He had never done such a thing in\n",
      "his life before, and I was horrified. Fancy—just as I had planned to\n",
      "come to it myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused on the path and looked up at Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Rose, trying to think of something else to talk about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you see why I say I’ve been a mean dog. He had planned a holiday\n",
      "in Italy with me, and I had planned a holiday in Italy leaving him at\n",
      "home. I think,” she went on, her eyes fixed on Rose’s face, “Mellersh\n",
      "has every reason to be both angry and hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot was astonished. The extraordinary quickness with which,\n",
      "hour by hour, under her very eyes, Lotty became more selfless,\n",
      "disconcerted her. She was turning into something surprisingly like a\n",
      "saint. Here she was now being affectionate about Mellersh—Mellersh, who\n",
      "only that morning, while they hung their feet into the sea, had seemed\n",
      "a mere iridescence, Lotty had told her, a thing of gauze. That was only\n",
      "that morning; and by the time they had had lunch Lotty had developed so\n",
      "far as to have got him solid enough again to write to, and to write to\n",
      "at length. And now, a few minutes later, she was announcing that he had\n",
      "every reason to be angry with her and hurt, and that she herself had\n",
      "been—the language was unusual, but it did express real penitence—a mean\n",
      "dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose stared at her astonished. If she went on like this, soon a nimbus\n",
      "might be expected round her head, was there already, if one didn’t know\n",
      "it was the sun through the tree-trunks catching her sandy hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great desire to love and be friends, to love everybody, to be friends\n",
      "with everybody, seemed to be invading Lotty—a desire for sheer\n",
      "goodness. Rose’s own experience was that goodness, the state of being\n",
      "good, was only reached with difficulty and pain. It took a long time to\n",
      "get to it; in fact one never did get to it, or, if for a flashing\n",
      "instant one did, it was only for a flashing instant. Desperate\n",
      "perseverance was needed to struggle along its path, and all the way was\n",
      "dotted with doubts. Lotty simply flew along. She had certainly, thought\n",
      "Rose, not got rid of her impetuousness. It had merely taken another\n",
      "direction. She was now impetuously becoming a saint. Could one really\n",
      "attain goodness so violently? Wouldn’t there be an equally violent\n",
      "reaction?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shouldn’t,” said Rose with caution, looking down into Lotty’s bright\n",
      "eyes—the path was steep, so that Lotty was well below her—“I shouldn’t\n",
      "be sure of that too quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I am sure of it, and I’ve written and told him so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose stared. “Why, but only this morning—” she began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all in this,” interrupted Lotty, tapping the envelope and looking\n",
      "pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What—everything?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean about the advertisement and my savings being spent? Oh no—not\n",
      "yet. But I’ll tell him all that when he comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When he comes?” repeated Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve invited him to come and stay with us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose could only go on staring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the least I could do. Besides—look at this.” Lotty waved her\n",
      "hand. “Disgusting not to share it. I was a mean dog to go off and leave\n",
      "him, but no dog I’ve ever heard of was ever as mean as I’d be if I\n",
      "didn’t try and persuade Mellersh to come out and enjoy this too. It’s\n",
      "barest decency that he should have some of the fun out of my nest-egg.\n",
      "After all, he has housed me and fed me for years. One shouldn’t be\n",
      "churlish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—do you think he’ll come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I hope so,” said Lotty with the utmost earnestness; and added,\n",
      "“Poor lamb.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that Rose felt she would like to sit down. Mellersh a poor lamb?\n",
      "That same Mellersh who a few hours before was mere shimmer? There was a\n",
      "seat at the bend of the path, and Rose went to it and sat down. She\n",
      "wished to get her breath, gain time. If she had time she might perhaps\n",
      "be able to catch up the leaping Lotty, and perhaps be able to stop her\n",
      "before she committed herself to what she probably presently would be\n",
      "sorry for. Mellersh at San Salvatore? Mellersh, from whom Lotty had\n",
      "taken such pains so recently to escape?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see him here,” said Lotty, as if in answer to her thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose looked at her with real concern: for every time Lotty said in that\n",
      "convinced voice, “I see,” what she saw came true. Then it was to be\n",
      "supposed that Mr. Wilkins too would presently come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish,” said Rose anxiously, “I understood you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t try,” said Lotty, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I must, because I love you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Rose,” said Lotty, swiftly bending down and kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re so quick,” said Rose. “I can’t follow your developments. I\n",
      "can’t keep touch. It was what happened with Freder—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She broke off and looked frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole idea of our coming here,” she went on again, as Lotty didn’t\n",
      "seem to have noticed, “was to get away, wasn’t it? Well, we’ve got\n",
      "away. And now, after only a single day of it, you want to write to the\n",
      "very people—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The very people we were getting away from,” finished Lotty. “It’s\n",
      "quite true. It seems idiotically illogical. But I’m so happy, I’m so\n",
      "well, I feel so fearfully wholesome. This place—why, it makes me feel\n",
      "flooded with love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she stared down at Rose in a kind of radiant surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose was silent a moment. Then she said, “And do you think it will have\n",
      "the same effect on Mr. Wilkins?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty laughed. “I don’t know,” she said. “But even if it doesn’t,\n",
      "there’s enough love about to flood fifty Mr. Wilkinses, as you call\n",
      "him. The great thing is to have lots of love about. I don’t see,” she\n",
      "went on, “at least I don’t see here, though I did at home, that it\n",
      "matters who loves as long as somebody does. I was a stingy beast at\n",
      "home, and used to measure and count. I had a queer obsession about\n",
      "justice. As though justice mattered. As though justice can really be\n",
      "distinguished from vengeance. It’s only love that’s any good. At home I\n",
      "wouldn’t love Mellersh unless he loved me back, exactly as much,\n",
      "absolute fairness. Did you ever. And as he didn’t, neither did I, and\n",
      "the aridity of that house! The aridity ”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose said nothing. She was bewildered by Lotty. One odd effect of San\n",
      "Salvatore on her rapidly developing friend was her sudden free use of\n",
      "robust words. She had not used them in Hampstead. Beast and dog were\n",
      "more robust than Hampstead cared about. In words, too, Lotty had come\n",
      "unchained.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how she wished, oh how Rose wished, that she too could write to her\n",
      "husband and say “Come.” The Wilkins ménage, however pompous Mellersh\n",
      "might be, and he had seemed to Rose pompous, was on a healthier, more\n",
      "natural footing than hers. Lotty could write to Mellersh and would get\n",
      "an answer. She couldn’t write to Frederick, for only too well did she\n",
      "know he wouldn’t answer. At least, he might answer—a hurried scribble,\n",
      "showing how much bored he was at doing it, with perfunctory thanks for\n",
      "her letter. But that would be worse than no answer at all; for his\n",
      "handwriting, her name on an envelope addressed by him, stabbed her\n",
      "heart. Too acutely did it bring back the letters of their beginnings\n",
      "together, the letters from him so desolate with separation, so aching\n",
      "with love and longing. To see apparently one of these very same letters\n",
      "arrive, and open it and find:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Rose—Thanks for letter. Glad you’re having a good time. Don’t\n",
      "hurry back. Say if you want any money. Everything going splendidly\n",
      "here.—Yours,\n",
      "                                                         Frederick.\n",
      "\n",
      "—no, it couldn’t be borne.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I’ll come down to the village with you to-day,” she\n",
      "said, looking up at Lotty with eyes suddenly gone dim. “I think I want\n",
      "to think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said Lotty, at once starting off briskly down the path.\n",
      "“But don’t think too long,” she called back over her shoulder. “Write\n",
      "and invite him at once.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Your husband.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the evening meal, which was the first time the whole four sat round\n",
      "the dining-room table together, Scrap appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "She appeared quite punctually, and in one of those wrappers or\n",
      "tea-gowns which are sometimes described as ravishing. This one really\n",
      "was ravishing. It certainly ravished Mrs. Wilkins, who could not take\n",
      "her eyes off the enchanting figure opposite. It was a shell-pink\n",
      "garment, and clung to the adorable Scrap as though it, too, loved her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a beautiful dress!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What—this old rag?” said Scrap, glancing down at it as if to see which\n",
      "one she had got on. “I’ve had it a hundred years.” And she concentrated\n",
      "on her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be very cold in it,” said Mrs. Fisher, thin-lipped; for it\n",
      "showed a great deal of Scrap—the whole of her arms, for instance, and\n",
      "even where it covered her up it was so thin that you still saw her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who—me?” said Scrap, looking up a moment. “Oh, no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she continued her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mustn’t catch a chill, you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, feeling\n",
      "that such loveliness must at all costs be preserved unharmed. “There’s\n",
      "a great difference here when the sun goes down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m quite warm,” said Scrap, industriously eating her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You look as if you had nothing at all on underneath,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t. At least, hardly anything,” said Scrap, finishing her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How very imprudent,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and how highly improper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Scrap stared at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher had arrived at dinner feeling friendly towards Lady\n",
      "Caroline. She at least had not intruded into her room and sat at her\n",
      "table and written with her pen. She did, Mrs. Fisher had supposed, know\n",
      "how to behave. Now it appeared that she did not know, for was this\n",
      "behaving, to come dressed—no, undressed—like that to a meal? Such\n",
      "behaviour was not only exceedingly improper but also most\n",
      "inconsiderate, for the indelicate creature would certainly catch a\n",
      "chill, and then infect the entire party. Mrs. Fisher had a great\n",
      "objection to other people’s chills. They were always the fruit of\n",
      "folly; and then they were handed on to her, who had done nothing at all\n",
      "to deserve them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bird-brained,” thought Mrs. Fisher, sternly contemplating Lady\n",
      "Caroline. “Not an idea in her head except vanity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are no men here,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “so how can it be\n",
      "improper? Have you noticed,” she inquired of Mrs. Fisher, who\n",
      "endeavoured to pretend she did not hear, “how difficult it is to be\n",
      "improper without men?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher neither answered her nor looked at her; but Scrap looked at\n",
      "her, and did that with her mouth which in any other mouth would have\n",
      "been a faint grin. Seen from without, across the bowl of nasturtiums,\n",
      "it was the most beautiful of brief and dimpled smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had a very alive sort of face, that one, thought Scrap, observing\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins with a dawn of interest. It was rather like a field of\n",
      "corn swept by lights and shadows. Both she and the dark one, Scrap\n",
      "noticed, had changed their clothes, but only in order to put on silk\n",
      "jumpers. The same amount of trouble would have been enough to dress\n",
      "them properly, reflected Scrap. Naturally they looked like nothing on\n",
      "earth in the jumpers. It didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher wore; indeed,\n",
      "the only thing for her, short of plumes and ermine, was what she did\n",
      "wear. But these others were quite young still, and quite attractive.\n",
      "They really definitely had faces. How different life would be for them\n",
      "if they made the most of themselves instead of the least. And yet—Scrap\n",
      "was suddenly bored, and turned away her thoughts and absently ate\n",
      "toast. What did it matter? If you did make the best of yourself, you\n",
      "only collected people round you who ended by wanting to grab.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had the most wonderful day,” began Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes\n",
      "shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap lowered hers. “Oh,” she thought, “she’s going to gush.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As though anybody were interested in her day,” thought Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "lowering hers also.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, whenever Mrs. Wilkins spoke Mrs. Fisher deliberately cast down\n",
      "her eyes. Thus would she mark her disapproval. Besides, it seemed the\n",
      "only safe thing to do with her eyes, for no one could tell what the\n",
      "uncurbed creature would say next. That which she had just said, for\n",
      "instance, about men—addressed too, to her—what could she mean? Better\n",
      "not conjecture, thought Mrs. Fisher; and her eyes, though cast down,\n",
      "yet saw Lady Caroline stretch out her hand to the Chianti flask and\n",
      "fill her glass again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again. She had done it once already, and the fish was only just going\n",
      "out of the room. Mrs. Fisher could see that the other respectable\n",
      "member of the party, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was noticing it too. Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot was, she hoped and believed, respectable and well-meaning. It\n",
      "is true she also had invaded her sitting-room, but no doubt she had\n",
      "been dragged there by the other one, and Mrs. Fisher had little if\n",
      "anything against Mrs. Arbuthnot, and observed with approval that she\n",
      "only drank water. That was as it should be. So, indeed, to give her her\n",
      "dues, did the freckled one; and very right at their age. She herself\n",
      "drank wine, but with what moderation: one meal, one glass. And she was\n",
      "sixty-five, and might properly, and even beneficially, have had at\n",
      "least two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” she said to Lady Caroline, cutting right across what Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins was telling them about her wonderful day and indicating the\n",
      "wine-glass, “is very bad for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline, however, could not have heard, for she continued to sip,\n",
      "her elbow on the table, and listen to what Mrs. Wilkins was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what was it she was saying? She had invited somebody to come and\n",
      "stay? A man?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher could not credit her ears. Yet it evidently was a man, for\n",
      "she spoke of the person as he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly and for the first time—but then this was most important—Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher addressed Mrs. Wilkins directly. She was sixty-five, and cared\n",
      "very little what sorts of women she happened to be with for a month,\n",
      "but if the women were to be mixed with men it was a different\n",
      "proposition altogether. She was not going to be made a cat’s-paw of.\n",
      "She had not come out there to sanction by her presence what used in her\n",
      "day to be called fast behaviour. Nothing had been said at the interview\n",
      "in London about men; if there had been she would have declined, of\n",
      "course, to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is his name?” asked Mrs. Fisher, abruptly interposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins turned to her with a slight surprise. “Wilkins,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilkins?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A relation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not blood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A connection?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher once more cast down her eyes. She could not talk to Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins. There was something about the things she said “A\n",
      "husband.” Suggesting one of many. Always that unseemly twist to\n",
      "everything. Why could she not say “My husband”? Besides, Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "had, she herself knew not for what reason, taken both the Hampstead\n",
      "young women for widows. War ones. There had been an absence of mention\n",
      "of husbands at the interview which would not, she considered, be\n",
      "natural if such persons did after all exist. And if a husband was not a\n",
      "relation, who was? “Not blood.” What a way to talk. Why, a husband was\n",
      "the first of all relations. How well she remembered Ruskin—no, it was\n",
      "not Ruskin, it was the Bible that said a man should leave his father\n",
      "and mother and cleave only to his wife; showing that she became by\n",
      "marriage an even more than blood relation. And if the husband’s father\n",
      "and mother were to be nothing to him compared to his wife, how much\n",
      "less than nothing ought the wife’s father and mother be to her compared\n",
      "to her husband. She herself had been unable to leave her father and\n",
      "mother in order to cleave to Mr. Fisher because they were no longer,\n",
      "when she married, alive, but she certainly would have left them if they\n",
      "had been there to leave. Not blood, indeed. Silly talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was very good. Succulence succeeded succulence. Costanza had\n",
      "determined to do as she chose in the matter of cream and eggs the first\n",
      "week, and see what happened at the end of it when the bills had to be\n",
      "paid. Her experience of the English was that they were quiet about\n",
      "bills. They were shy of words. They believed readily. Besides, who was\n",
      "the mistress here? In the absence of a definite one, it occurred to\n",
      "Costanza that she might as well be the mistress herself. So she did as\n",
      "she chose about the dinner, and it was very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four, however, were so much preoccupied by their own conversation\n",
      "that they ate it without noticing how good it was. Even Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "she who in such matters was manly, did not notice. The entire excellent\n",
      "cooking was to her as though it were not; which shows how much she must\n",
      "have been stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was stirred. It was that Mrs. Wilkins. She was enough to stir\n",
      "anybody. And she was undoubtedly encouraged by Lady Caroline, who, in\n",
      "her turn, was no doubt influenced by the Chianti.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher was very glad there were no men present, for they certainly\n",
      "would have been foolish about Lady Caroline. She was precisely the sort\n",
      "of young woman to unbalance them; especially, Mrs. Fisher recognised,\n",
      "at that moment. Perhaps it was the Chianti momentarily intensifying her\n",
      "personality, but she was undeniably most attractive; and there were few\n",
      "things Mrs. Fisher disliked more than having to look on while sensible,\n",
      "intelligent men, who the moment before were talking seriously and\n",
      "interestingly about real matters, became merely foolish and\n",
      "simpering—she had seen them actually simpering—just because in walked a\n",
      "bit of bird-brained beauty. Even Mr. Gladstone, that great wise\n",
      "statesman, whose hand had once rested for an unforgettable moment\n",
      "solemnly on her head, would have, she felt, on perceiving Lady Caroline\n",
      "left off talking sense and horribly embarked on badinage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” Mrs. Wilkins said—a silly trick that, with which she mostly\n",
      "began her sentences; Mrs. Fisher each time wished to say, “Pardon me—I\n",
      "do not see, I hear”—but why trouble?—“You see,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\n",
      "leaning across towards Lady Caroline, “we arranged, didn’t we, in\n",
      "London that if any of us wanted to we could each invite one guest. So\n",
      "now I’m doing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t remember that,” said Mrs. Fisher, her eyes on her plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, we did—didn’t we, Rose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—I remember,” said Lady Caroline. “Only it seemed so incredible\n",
      "that one could ever want to. One’s whole idea was to get away from\n",
      "one’s friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And one’s husbands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again that unseemly plural. But how altogether unseemly, thought Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher. Such implications. Mrs. Arbuthnot clearly thought so too, for\n",
      "she had turned red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And family affection,” said Lady Caroline—or was it the Chianti\n",
      "speaking? Surely it was the Chianti.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the want of family affection,” said Mrs. Wilkins—what a light she\n",
      "was throwing on her home life and real character.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That wouldn’t be so bad,” said Lady Caroline. “I’d stay with that. It\n",
      "would give one room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no, no—it’s dreadful,” cried Mrs. Wilkins. “It’s as if one had no\n",
      "clothes on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I like that,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a divine feeling, getting rid of things,” said Lady Caroline, who\n",
      "was talking altogether to Mrs. Wilkins and paid no attention to the\n",
      "other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but in a bitter wind to have nothing on and know there never will\n",
      "be anything on and you going to get colder and colder till at last you\n",
      "die of it—that’s what it was like, living with somebody who didn’t love\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These confidences, thought Mrs. Fisher  and no excuse whatever for\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, who was making them entirely on plain water. Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, judging from her face, quite shared Mrs. Fisher’s\n",
      "disapproval; she was fidgeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But didn’t he?” asked Lady Caroline—every bit as shamelessly\n",
      "unreticent as Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mellersh? He showed no signs of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Delicious,” murmured Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t think it was at all delicious. I was miserable. And now,\n",
      "since I’ve been here, I simply stare at myself being miserable. As\n",
      "miserable as that. And about Mellersh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean he wasn’t worth it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t. I mean I’ve suddenly got well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline, slowly twisting the stem of her glass in her fingers,\n",
      "scrutinised the lit-up face opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now I’m well I find I can’t sit here and gloat all to myself. I\n",
      "can’t be happy, shutting him out. I must share. I understand exactly\n",
      "what the Blessed Damozel felt like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was the Blessed Damozel?” asked Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher; and with such emphasis this time that Lady\n",
      "Caroline turned to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ought I to know?” she asked. “I don’t know any natural history. It\n",
      "sounds like a bird.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a poem,” said Mrs. Fisher with extraordinary frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll lend it to you,” said Mrs. Wilkins, over whose face laughter\n",
      "rippled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And its author,” said Mrs. Fisher icily, “though not perhaps quite\n",
      "what one would have wished him to be, was frequently at my father’s\n",
      "table.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a bore for you,” said Scrap. “That’s what mother’s always\n",
      "doing—inviting authors. I hate authors. I wouldn’t mind them so much if\n",
      "they didn’t write books. Go on about Mellersh,” she said, turning to\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All those empty beds,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What empty beds?” asked Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ones in this house. Why, of course they each ought to have\n",
      "somebody happy inside them. Eight beds, and only four people. It’s\n",
      "dreadful, dreadful to be so greedy and keep everything just for\n",
      "oneself. I want Rose to ask her husband out too. You and Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "haven’t got husbands, but why not give some friend a glorious time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose bit her lip. She turned red, she turned pale. If only Lotty would\n",
      "keep quiet, she thought. It was all very well to have suddenly become a\n",
      "saint and want to love everybody, but need she be so tactless? Rose\n",
      "felt that all her poor sore places were being danced on. If only Lotty\n",
      "would keep quiet \n",
      "\n",
      "And Mrs. Fisher, with even greater frostiness than that with which she\n",
      "had received Lady Caroline’s ignorance of the Blessed Damozel, said,\n",
      "“There is only one unoccupied bedroom in this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one?” echoed Mrs. Wilkins, astonished. “Then who are in all the\n",
      "others?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are,” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But we’re not in all the bedrooms. There must be at least six. That\n",
      "leaves two over, and the owner told us there were eight beds—didn’t he\n",
      "Rose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are six bedrooms,” said Mrs. Fisher; for both she and Lady\n",
      "Caroline had thoroughly searched the house on arriving, in order to see\n",
      "which part of it they would be most comfortable in, and they both knew\n",
      "that there were six bedrooms, two of which were very small, and in one\n",
      "of these small ones Francesca slept in the company of a chair and a\n",
      "chest of drawers, and the other, similarly furnished, was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot had hardly looked at the house, having\n",
      "spent most of their time out-of-doors gaping at the scenery, and had,\n",
      "in the agitated inattentiveness of their minds when first they began\n",
      "negotiating for San Salvatore, got into their heads that the eight beds\n",
      "of which the owner spoke were the same as eight bedrooms; which they\n",
      "were not. There were indeed eight beds, but four of them were in Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins’s and Mrs. Arbuthnot’s rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are six bedrooms,” repeated Mrs. Fisher. “We have four,\n",
      "Francesca has the fifth, and the sixth is empty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So that,” said Scrap, “however kind we feel we would be if we could,\n",
      "we can’t. Isn’t it fortunate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But then there’s only room for one?” said Mrs. Wilkins, looking round\n",
      "at the three faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—and you’ve got him,” said Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins was taken aback. This question of the beds was unexpected.\n",
      "In inviting Mellersh she had intended to put him in one of the four\n",
      "spare-rooms that she imagined were there. When there were plenty of\n",
      "rooms and enough servants there was no reason why they should, as they\n",
      "did in their small, two-servanted house at home, share the same one.\n",
      "Love, even universal love, the kind of love with which she felt herself\n",
      "flooded, should not be tried. Much patience and self-effacement were\n",
      "needed for successful married sleep. Placidity; a steady faith; these\n",
      "too were needed. She was sure she would be much fonder of Mellersh, and\n",
      "he not mind her nearly so much, if they were not shut up together at\n",
      "night, if in the morning they could meet with the cheery affection of\n",
      "friends between whom lies no shadow of differences about the window or\n",
      "the washing arrangements, or of absurd little choked-down resentments\n",
      "at something that had seemed to one of them unfair. Her happiness, she\n",
      "felt, and her ability to be friends with everybody, was the result of\n",
      "her sudden new freedom and its peace. Would there be that sense of\n",
      "freedom, that peace, after a night shut up with Mellersh? Would she be\n",
      "able in the morning to be full towards him, as she was at that moment\n",
      "full, of nothing at all but loving-kindness? After all, she hadn’t been\n",
      "very long in heaven. Suppose she hadn’t been in it long enough for her\n",
      "to have become fixed in blandness? And only that morning what an\n",
      "extraordinary joy it had been to find herself alone when she woke, and\n",
      "able to pull the bed-clothes any way she liked!\n",
      "\n",
      "Francesca had to nudge her. She was so much absorbed that she did not\n",
      "notice the pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, distractedly helping herself, “I share my\n",
      "room with Mellersh I risk losing all I now feel about him. If on the\n",
      "other hand I put him in the one spare-room, I prevent Mrs. Fisher and\n",
      "Lady Caroline from giving somebody a treat. True they don’t seem to\n",
      "want to at present, but at any moment in this place one or the other of\n",
      "them may be seized with a desire to make somebody happy, and then they\n",
      "wouldn’t be able to because of Mellersh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a problem,” she said aloud, her eyebrows puckered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is?” asked Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where to put Mellersh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap stared. “Why, isn’t one room enough for him?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, quite. But then there won’t be any room left at all—any room\n",
      "for somebody you may want to invite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shan’t want to,” said Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or you,” said Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Fisher. “Rose, of course, doesn’t\n",
      "count. I’m sure she would like sharing her room with her husband. It’s\n",
      "written all over her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really what?” asked Mrs. Wilkins, turning hopefully to her, for she\n",
      "thought the word this time was the preliminary to a helpful suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not. It stood by itself. It was, as before, mere frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenged, however, Mrs. Fisher did fasten it on to a sentence.\n",
      "“Really am I to understand,” she asked, “that you propose to reserve\n",
      "the one spare-room for the exclusive use of your own family?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He isn’t my own family,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He’s my husband. You\n",
      "see—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see nothing,” Mrs. Fisher could not this time refrain from\n",
      "interrupting—for what an intolerable trick. “At the most I hear, and\n",
      "that reluctantly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Wilkins, as impervious to rebuke as Mrs. Fisher had feared,\n",
      "immediately repeated the tiresome formula and launched out into a long\n",
      "and excessively indelicate speech about the best place for the person\n",
      "she called Mellersh to sleep in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mellersh—Mrs. Fisher, remembering the Thomases and Johns and Alfreds\n",
      "and Roberts of her day, plain names that yet had all become glorious,\n",
      "thought it sheer affectation to be christened Mellersh—was, it seemed,\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins’s husband, and therefore his place was clearly indicated.\n",
      "Why this talk? She herself, as if foreseeing his arrival, had had a\n",
      "second bed put in Mrs. Wilkins’s room. There were certain things in\n",
      "life which were never talked about but only done. Most things connected\n",
      "with husbands were not talked about; and to have a whole dinner-table\n",
      "taken up with a discussion as to where one of them should sleep was an\n",
      "affront to the decencies. How and where husbands slept should be known\n",
      "only to their wives. Sometimes it was not known to them, and then the\n",
      "marriage had less happy moments; but these moments were not talked\n",
      "about either; the decencies continued to be preserved. At least, it was\n",
      "so in her day. To have to hear whether Mr. Wilkins should or should not\n",
      "sleep with Mrs. Wilkins, and the reasons why he should and the reasons\n",
      "why he shouldn’t, was both uninteresting and indelicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She might have succeeded in imposing propriety and changing the\n",
      "conversation if it had not been for Lady Caroline. Lady Caroline\n",
      "encouraged Mrs. Wilkins, and threw herself into the discussion with\n",
      "every bit as much unreserve as Mrs. Wilkins herself. No doubt she was\n",
      "impelled on this occasion by Chianti, but whatever the reason there it\n",
      "was. And, characteristically, Lady Caroline was all for Mr. Wilkins\n",
      "being given the solitary spare-room. She took that for granted. Any\n",
      "other arrangement would be impossible, she said; her expression was,\n",
      "“Barbarous.” Had she never read her Bible, Mrs. Fisher was tempted to\n",
      "inquire—And they two shall be one flesh? Clearly also, then, one\n",
      "room. But Mrs. Fisher did not inquire. She did not care even to allude\n",
      "to such texts to some one unmarried.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there was one way she could force Mr. Wilkins into his proper\n",
      "place and save the situation: she could say she herself intended to\n",
      "invite a friend. It was her right. They had all said so. Apart from\n",
      "propriety, it was monstrous that Mrs. Wilkins should want to monopolise\n",
      "the one spare-room, when in her own room was everything necessary for\n",
      "her husband. Perhaps she really would invite somebody—not invite, but\n",
      "suggest coming. There was Kate Lumley, for instance. Kate could\n",
      "perfectly afford to come and pay her share; and she was of her own\n",
      "period and knew, and had known, most of the people she herself knew and\n",
      "had known. Kate, of course, had only been on the fringe; she used to be\n",
      "asked only to the big parties, not to the small ones, and she still was\n",
      "only on the fringe. There were some people who never got off the\n",
      "fringe, and Kate was one. Often, however, such people were more\n",
      "permanently agreeable to be with than the others, in that they remained\n",
      "grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; she might really consider Kate. The poor soul had never married,\n",
      "but then everybody could not expect to marry, and she was quite\n",
      "comfortably off—not too comfortably, but just comfortably enough to pay\n",
      "her own expenses if she came and yet be grateful. Yes; Kate was the\n",
      "solution. If she came, at one stroke, Mrs. Fisher saw, would the\n",
      "Wilkinses be regularised and Mrs. Wilkins be prevented from having more\n",
      "than her share of the rooms. Also, Mrs. Fisher would save herself from\n",
      "isolation; spiritual isolation. She desired physical isolation between\n",
      "meals, but she disliked that isolation which is of the spirit. Such\n",
      "isolation would, she feared, certainly be hers with these three\n",
      "alien-minded young women. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot was, owing to her\n",
      "friendship with Mrs. Wilkins, necessarily alien-minded. In Kate she\n",
      "would have a support. Kate, without intruding on her sitting-room, for\n",
      "Kate was tractable, would be there at meals to support her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher said nothing at the moment; but presently in the\n",
      "drawing-room, when they were gathered round the wood fire—she had\n",
      "discovered there was no fireplace in her own sitting-room, and\n",
      "therefore she would after all be forced, so long as the evenings\n",
      "remained cool, to spend them in the other room—presently, while\n",
      "Francesca was handing coffee round and Lady Caroline was poisoning the\n",
      "air with smoke, Mrs. Wilkins, looking relieved and pleased, said:\n",
      "“Well, if nobody really wants that room, and wouldn’t use it anyhow, I\n",
      "shall be very glad if Mellersh may have it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he must have it,” said Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Fisher spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have a friend,” she said in her deep voice; and sudden silence fell\n",
      "upon the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kate Lumley,” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps,” continued Mrs. Fisher, addressing Lady Caroline, “you know\n",
      "her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Lady Caroline did not know Kate Lumley; and Mrs. Fisher, without\n",
      "asking the others if they did, for she was sure they knew no one,\n",
      "proceeded. “I wish to invite her to join me,” said Mrs. Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Scrap said, turning to Mrs. Wilkins, “That settles Mellersh,\n",
      "then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It settles the question of Mr. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Fisher, “although I\n",
      "am unable to understand that there should ever have been a question, in\n",
      "the only way that is right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid you’re in for it, then,” said Lady Caroline, again to Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins. “Unless,” she added, “he can’t come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Wilkins, her brow perturbed—for suppose after all she were not\n",

      "The uneventful days—only outwardly uneventful—slipped by in floods of\n",
      "sunshine, and the servants, watching the four ladies, came to the\n",
      "conclusion there was very little life in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the servants San Salvatore seemed asleep. No one came to tea, nor\n",
      "did the ladies go anywhere to tea. Other tenants in other springs had\n",
      "been far more active. There had been stir and enterprise; the boat had\n",
      "been used; excursions had been made; Beppo’s fly was ordered; people\n",
      "from Mezzago came over and spent the day; the house rang with voices;\n",
      "even sometimes champagne had been drunk. Life was varied, life was\n",
      "interesting. But this? What was this? The servants were not even\n",
      "scolded. They were left completely to themselves. They yawned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perplexing, too, was the entire absence of gentlemen. How could\n",
      "gentlemen keep away from so much beauty? For, added up, and even after\n",
      "the subtraction of the old one, the three younger ladies produced a\n",
      "formidable total of that which gentlemen usually sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the evident desire of each lady to spend long hours separated from\n",
      "the other ladies puzzled the servants. The result was a deathly\n",
      "stillness in the house, except at meal-times. It might have been as\n",
      "empty as it had been all the winter, for any sounds of life there were.\n",
      "The old lady sat in her room, alone; the dark-eyed lady wandered off\n",
      "alone, loitering, so Domenico told them, who sometimes came across her\n",
      "in the course of his duties, incomprehensibly among the rocks; the very\n",
      "beautiful fair lady lay in her low chair in the top garden, alone; the\n",
      "less, but still beautiful fair lady went up the hills and stayed up\n",
      "them for hours, alone; and every day the sun blazed slowly round the\n",
      "house, and disappeared at evening into the sea, and nothing at all had\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants yawned.\n",

      "Yet the four visitors, while their bodies sat—that was Mrs. Fisher’s—or\n",

      "went in solitude up into the hills—that was Mrs. Wilkins’s—were\n",
      "anything but torpid really. Their minds were unusually busy. Even at\n",
      "night their minds were busy, and the dreams they had were clear, thin,\n",
      "quick things, entirely different from the heavy dreams of home. There\n",
      "was that in the atmosphere of San Salvatore which produced\n",
      "active-mindedness in all except the natives. They, as before, whatever\n",
      "the beauty around them, whatever the prodigal seasons did, remained\n",
      "immune from thoughts other than those they were accustomed to. All\n",
      "their lives they had seen, year by year, the amazing recurrent\n",
      "spectacle of April in the gardens, and custom had made it invisible to\n",
      "them. They were as blind to it, as unconscious of it, as Domenico’s dog\n",
      "asleep in the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitors could not be blind to it—it was too arresting after London\n",
      "in a particularly wet and gloomy March. Suddenly to be transported to\n",
      "that place where the air was so still that it held its breath, where\n",
      "the light was so golden that the most ordinary things were\n",
      "transfigured—to be transported into that delicate warmth, that\n",
      "caressing fragrance, and to have the old grey castle as the setting,\n",
      "and, in the distance, the serene clear hills of Perugini’s backgrounds,\n",
      "was an astonishing contrast. Even Lady Caroline, used all her life to\n",
      "beauty, who had been everywhere and seen everything, felt the surprise\n",
      "of it. It was, that year, a particularly wonderful spring, and of all\n",
      "the months at San Salvatore April, if the weather was fine, was best.\n",
      "May scorched and withered; March was restless, and could be hard and\n",
      "cold in its brightness; but April came along softly like a blessing,\n",
      "and if it were a fine April it was so beautiful that it was impossible\n",
      "not to feel different, not to feel stirred and touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins, we have seen, responded to it instantly. She, so to\n",
      "speak, at once flung off all her garments and dived straight into\n",
      "glory, unhesitatingly, with a cry of rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot was stirred and touched, but differently. She had odd\n",
      "sensations—presently to be described.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, being old, was of a closer, more impermeable texture, and\n",
      "offered more resistance; but she too had odd sensations, also in their\n",

      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline, already amply acquainted with beautiful houses and\n",
      "climates, to whom they could not come quite with the same surprise, yet\n",
      "was very nearly as quick to react as Mrs. Wilkins. The place had an\n",
      "almost instantaneous influence on her as well, and of one part of this\n",
      "influence she was aware: it had made her, beginning on the very first\n",
      "evening, want to think, and acted on her curiously like a conscience.\n",
      "What this conscience seemed to press upon her notice with an insistence\n",
      "that startled her—Lady Caroline hesitated to accept the word, but it\n",
      "would keep on coming into her head—was that she was tawdry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tawdry. She. Fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She must think that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning after the first dinner together, she woke up in a condition\n",
      "of regret that she should have been so talkative to Mrs. Wilkins the\n",
      "night before. What had made her be, she wondered. Now, of course, Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins would want to grab, she would want to be inseparable; and the\n",
      "thought of a grabbing and an inseparableness that should last four\n",
      "weeks made Scrap’s spirit swoon within her. No doubt the encouraged\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins would be lurking in the top garden waiting to waylay her\n",
      "when she went out, and would hail her with morning cheerfulness. How\n",
      "much she hated being hailed with morning cheerfulness—or indeed, hailed\n",
      "at all. She oughtn’t to have encouraged Mrs. Wilkins the night before.\n",
      "Fatal to encourage. It was bad enough not to encourage, for just\n",
      "sitting there and saying nothing seemed usually to involve her, but\n",
      "actively to encourage was suicidal. What on earth had made her? Now she\n",
      "would have to waste all the precious time, the precious, lovely time\n",
      "for thinking in, for getting square with herself, in shaking Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins off.\n",
      "\n",
      "With great caution and on the tips of her toes, balancing herself\n",
      "carefully lest the pebbles should scrunch, she stole out when she was\n",
      "dressed to her corner; but the garden was empty. No shaking off was\n",
      "necessary. Neither Mrs. Wilkins nor anybody else was to be seen. She\n",
      "had it entirely to herself. Except for Domenico, who presently came and\n",
      "hovered, watering his plants, again especially all the plants that were\n",
      "nearest her, no one came out at all; and when, after a long while of\n",
      "following up thoughts which seemed to escape her just as she had got\n",
      "them, and dropping off exhausted to sleep in the intervals of this\n",
      "chase, she felt hungry and looked at her watch and saw that it was past\n",
      "three, she realised that nobody had even bothered to call her in to\n",
      "lunch. So that, Scrap could not but remark, if any one was shaken off\n",
      "it was she herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but how delightful, and how very new. Now she would really be\n",
      "able to think, uninterruptedly. Delicious to be forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, she was hungry; and Mrs. Wilkins, after that excessive\n",
      "friendliness the night before, might at least have told her lunch was\n",
      "ready. And she had really been excessively friendly—so nice about\n",
      "Mellersh’s sleeping arrangements, wanting him to have the spare-room\n",
      "and all. She wasn’t usually interested in arrangements, in fact she\n",
      "wasn’t ever interested in them; so that Scrap considered she might be\n",
      "said almost to have gone out of her way to be agreeable to Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins. And, in return, Mrs. Wilkins didn’t even bother whether or not\n",
      "she had any lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, though she was hungry, she didn’t mind missing a meal.\n",
      "Life was full of meals. They took up an enormous proportion of one’s\n",
      "time; and Mrs. Fisher was, she was afraid, one of those persons who at\n",
      "meals linger. Twice now had she dined with Mrs. Fisher, and each time\n",
      "she had been difficult at the end to dislodge, lingering on slowly\n",
      "cracking innumerable nuts and slowly drinking a glass of wine that\n",
      "seemed as if it would never be finished. Probably it would be a good\n",
      "thing to make a habit of missing lunch, and as it was quite easy to\n",
      "have tea brought out to her, and as she breakfasted in her room, only\n",
      "once a day would she have to sit at the dining-room table and endure\n",
      "the nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap burrowed her head comfortably in the cushions, and with her feet\n",
      "crossed on the low parapet gave herself up to more thought. She said to\n",
      "herself, as she had said at intervals throughout the morning: Now I’m\n",
      "going to think. But, never having thought out anything in her life, it\n",
      "was difficult. Extraordinary how one’s attention wouldn’t stay fixed;\n",
      "extraordinary how one’s mind slipped sideways. Settling herself down to\n",
      "a review of her past as a preliminary to the consideration of her\n",
      "future, and hunting in it to begin with for any justification of that\n",
      "distressing word tawdry, the next thing she knew was that she wasn’t\n",
      "thinking about this at all, but had somehow switched on to Mr. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Mr. Wilkins was quite easy to think about, though not pleasant.\n",
      "She viewed his approach with misgivings. For not only was it a profound\n",
      "and unexpected bore to have a man added to the party, and a man, too,\n",
      "of the kind she was sure Mr. Wilkins must be, but she was afraid—and\n",
      "her fear was the result of a drearily unvarying experience—that he\n",
      "might wish to hang about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This possibility had evidently not yet occurred to Mrs. Wilkins, and it\n",
      "was not one to which she could very well draw her attention; not, that\n",
      "is, without being too fatuous to live. She tried to hope that Mr.\n",
      "Wilkins would be a wonderful exception to the dreadful rule. If only he\n",
      "were, she would be so much obliged to him that she believed she might\n",
      "really quite like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But—she had misgivings. Suppose he hung about her so that she was\n",
      "driven from her lovely top garden; suppose the light in Mrs. Wilkins’s\n",
      "funny, flickering face was blown out. Scrap felt she would particularly\n",
      "dislike this to happen to Mrs. Wilkins’s face, yet she had never in her\n",
      "life met any wives, not any at all, who had been able to understand\n",
      "that she didn’t in the least want their husbands. Often she had met\n",
      "wives who didn’t want their husbands either, but that made them none\n",
      "the less indignant if they thought somebody else did, and none the less\n",
      "sure, when they saw them hanging round Scrap, that she was trying to\n",
      "get them. Trying to get them! The bare thought, the bare recollection\n",
      "of these situations, filled her with a boredom so extreme that it\n",
      "instantly sent her to sleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she woke up she went on with Mr. Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if, thought Scrap, Mr. Wilkins were not an exception and behaved in\n",
      "the usual way, would Mrs. Wilkins understand, or would it just simply\n",
      "spoil her holiday? She seemed quick, but would she be quick about just\n",
      "this? She seemed to understand and see inside one, but would she\n",
      "understand and see inside one when it came to Mr. Wilkins?\n",
      "\n",
      "The experienced Scrap was full of doubts. She shifted her feet on the\n",
      "parapet; she jerked a cushion straight. Perhaps she had better try and\n",
      "explain to Mrs. Wilkins, during the days still remaining before the\n",
      "arrival—explain in a general way, rather vague and talking at large—her\n",
      "attitude towards such things. She might also expound to her her\n",
      "peculiar dislike of people’s husbands, and her profound craving to be,\n",
      "at least for this one month, let alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrap had her doubts about this too. Such talk meant a certain\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It appeared that Mrs. Wilkins had not been seen since breakfast. Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot thought she had probably gone for a picnic. Scrap missed her.\n",
      "She ate the enormous macaroons, the best and biggest she had ever come\n",
      "across, in silence. Tea without Mrs. Wilkins was dull; and Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot had that fatal flavour of motherliness about her, of wanting\n",
      "to pet one, to make one very comfortable, coaxing one to eat—coaxing\n",
      "her, who was already so frankly, so even excessively, eating—that\n",
      "seemed to have dogged Scrap’s steps through life. Couldn’t people leave\n",
      "one alone? She was perfectly able to eat what she wanted unincited. She\n",
      "tried to quench Mrs. Arbuthnot’s zeal by being short with her. Useless.\n",
      "The shortness was not apparent. It remained, as all Scrap’s evil\n",

      "loveliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher sat monumentally, and took no notice of either of them. She\n",
      "had had a curious day, and was a little worried. She had been quite\n",

      "taken the trouble to let her know they were not coming; and Mrs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher was prepared not to dislike Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose parted\n",
      "hair and mild expression seemed very decent and womanly, but she\n",

      "instantly echoing any offer made her of food or drink, of throwing the\n",
      "offer back on one, as it were, was not somehow what one expected of\n",
      "her. “Will you have some more tea?” was surely a question to which the\n",
      "answer was simply yes or no; but Mrs. Arbuthnot persisted in the trick\n",
      "she had exhibited the day before at breakfast, of adding to her yes\n",
      "or no the words, “Will you?” She had done it again that morning at\n",
      "breakfast and here she was doing it at tea—the two meals at which Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher presided and poured out. Why did she do it? Mrs. Fisher failed\n",
      "to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not what was worrying her; this was merely by the way.\n",
      "What was worrying her was that she had been quite unable that day to\n",
      "settle to anything, and had done nothing but wander restlessly from her\n",
      "sitting-room to her battlements and back again. It had been a wasted\n",
      "day, and how much she disliked waste. She had tried to read, and she\n",
      "had tried to write to Kate Lumley; but no—a few words read, a few lines\n",
      "written, and up she got again and went out on to the battlements and\n",
      "stared at the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not matter that the letter to Kate Lumley should not be written.\n",
      "There was time enough for that. Let the others suppose her coming was\n",
      "definitely fixed. All the better. So would Mr. Wilkins be kept out of\n",
      "the spare-room and put where he belonged. Kate would keep. She could be\n",
      "held in reserve. Kate in reserve was just as potent as Kate in\n",
      "actuality, and there were points about Kate in reserve which might be\n",
      "missing from Kate in actuality. For instance, if Mrs. Fisher were going\n",
      "to be restless, she would rather Kate were not there to see. There was\n",
      "a want of dignity about restlessness, about trotting backwards and\n",
      "forwards. But it did matter that she could not read a sentence of any\n",
      "of her great dead friends’ writings; no, not even of Browning’s, who\n",
      "had been so much in Italy, nor of Ruskin’s, whose Stones of Venice\n",
      "she had brought with her to re-read so nearly on the very spot; nor\n",
      "even a sentence of a really interesting book like the one she had found\n",
      "in her sitting-room about the home life of the German Emperor, poor\n",
      "man—written in the nineties, when he had not yet begun to be more\n",
      "sinned against than sinning, which was, she was firmly convinced, what\n",
      "was the matter with him now, and full of exciting things about his\n",
      "birth and his right arm and accoucheurs—without having to put it down\n",
      "and go and stare at the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading was very important; the proper exercise and development of\n",
      "one’s mind was a paramount duty. How could one read if one were\n",
      "constantly trotting in and out? Curious, this restlessness. Was she\n",
      "going to be ill? No, she felt well; indeed, unusually well, and she\n",
      "went in and out quite quickly—trotted, in fact—and without her stick.\n",
      "Very odd that she shouldn’t be able to sit still, she thought, frowning\n",
      "across the tops of some purple hyacinths at the Gulf of Spezia\n",
      "glittering beyond a headland; very odd that she, who walked so slowly,\n",
      "with such dependence on her stick, should suddenly trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be interesting to talk to some one about it, she felt. Not to\n",
      "Kate—to a stranger. Kate would only look at her and suggest a cup of\n",
      "tea. Kate always suggested cups of tea. Besides, Kate had a flat face.\n",
      "That Mrs. Wilkins, now—annoying as she was, loose-tongued as she was,\n",
      "impertinent, objectionable, would probably understand, and perhaps know\n",
      "what was making her be like this. But she could say nothing to Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins. She was the last person to whom one would admit sensations.\n",
      "Dignity alone forbade it. Confide in Mrs. Wilkins? Never.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mrs. Arbuthnot, while she wistfully mothered the obstructive Scrap\n",
      "at tea, felt too that she had had a curious day. Like Mrs. Fisher’s, it\n",
      "had been active, but, unlike Mrs. Fisher’s, only active in mind. Her\n",
      "body had been quite still; her mind had not been still at all, it had\n",
      "been excessively active. For years she had taken care to have no time\n",
      "to think. Her scheduled life in the parish had prevented memories and\n",
      "desires from intruding on her. That day they had crowded. She went back\n",
      "to tea feeling dejected, and that she should feel dejected in such a\n",
      "place with everything about her to make her rejoice, only dejected her\n",
      "the more. But how could she rejoice alone? How could anybody rejoice\n",
      "and enjoy and appreciate, really appreciate, alone? Except Lotty. Lotty\n",
      "seemed able to. She had gone off down the hill directly after\n",
      "breakfast, alone yet obviously rejoicing, for she had not suggested\n",
      "that Rose should go too, and she was singing as she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose had spent the day by herself, sitting with her hands clasping her\n",
      "knees, staring straight in front of her. What she was staring at were\n",
      "the grey swords of the agaves, and, on their tall stalks, the pale\n",
      "irises that grew in the remote place she had found, while beyond them,\n",
      "between the grey leaves and the blue flowers, she saw the sea. The\n",
      "place she had found was a hidden corner where the sun-baked stones were\n",
      "padded with thyme, and nobody was likely to come. It was out of sight\n",
      "and sound of the house; it was off any path; it was near the end of the\n",
      "promontory. She sat so quiet that presently lizards darted over her\n",
      "feet, and some tiny birds like finches, frightened away at first, came\n",
      "back again and flitted among the bushes round her just as if she hadn’t\n",
      "been there. How beautiful it was. And what was the good of it with no\n",
      "one there, no one who loved being with one, who belonged to one, to\n",
      "whom one could say, “Look.” And wouldn’t one say, “Look—dearest?”\n",
      "Yes, one would say dearest and the sweet word, just to say it to\n",
      "somebody who loved one, would make one happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat quite still, staring straight in front of her. Strange that in\n",
      "this place she did not want to pray. She who had prayed so constantly\n",
      "at home didn’t seem able to do it here at all. The first morning she\n",
      "had merely thrown up a brief thank you to heaven on getting out of bed,\n",
      "and had gone straight to the window to see what everything looked\n",
      "like—thrown up the thank you as carelessly as a ball, and thought no\n",
      "more about it. That morning, remembering this and ashamed, she had\n",
      "knelt down with determination; but perhaps determination was bad for\n",
      "prayers, for she had been unable to think of a thing to say. And as for\n",
      "her bedtime prayers, on neither of the nights had she said a single\n",
      "one. She had forgotten them. She had been so much absorbed in other\n",
      "thoughts that she had forgotten them; and, once in bed, she was asleep\n",
      "and whirling along among bright, thin swift dreams before she had so\n",
      "much time as to stretch herself out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had come over her? Why had she let go the anchor of prayer? And\n",
      "she had difficulty, too, in remembering her poor, in remembering even\n",
      "that there were such things as poor. Holidays, of course, were good,\n",
      "and were recognised by everybody as good, but ought they so completely\n",
      "to blot out, to make such havoc of, the realities? Perhaps it was\n",
      "healthy to forget her poor; with all the greater gusto would she go\n",
      "back to them. But it couldn’t be healthy to forget her prayers, and\n",
      "still less could it be healthy not to mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose did not mind. She knew she did not mind. And, even worse, she knew\n",
      "she did not mind not minding. In this place she was indifferent to both\n",

      "happy for years. Well, if only she could rejoice in her wonderful new\n",
      "surroundings, have that much at least to set against the indifference,\n",
      "the letting go—but she could not. She had no work; she did not pray;\n",

      "he left her dreams free and was with her during the day instead. And\n",
      "again that morning, as she was struggling not to think of him, Lotty\n",
      "had asked her, just before disappearing singing down the path, if she\n",

      "her. What could they talk about? Between them was the barrier of his\n",
      "work and her religion. She could not—how could she, believing as she\n",
      "did in purity, in responsibility for the effect of one’s actions on\n",
      "others—bear his work, bear living by it; and he, she knew, had at first\n",
      "resented and then been merely bored by her religion. He had let her\n",
      "slip away; he had given her up; he no longer minded; he accepted her\n",
      "religion indifferently, as a settled fact. Both it and she—Rose’s mind,\n",
      "becoming more luminous in the clear light of April at San Salvatore,\n",
      "suddenly saw the truth—bored him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally when she saw this, when that morning it flashed upon her for\n",
      "the first time, she did not like it; she liked it so little that for a\n",
      "space the whole beauty of Italy was blotted out. What was to be done\n",
      "about it? She could not give up believing in good and not liking evil,\n",
      "and it must be evil to live entirely on the proceeds of adulteries,\n",
      "however dead and distinguished they were. Besides, if she did, if she\n",
      "sacrificed her whole past, her bringing up, her work for the last ten\n",
      "years, would she bore him less? Rose felt right down at her very roots\n",
      "that if you have once thoroughly bored somebody it is next to\n",
      "impossible to unbore him. Once a bore always a bore—certainly, she\n",
      "thought, to the person originally bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, thought she, looking out to sea through eyes grown misty, better\n",
      "cling to her religion. It was better—she hardly noticed the\n",
      "reprehensibleness of her thought—than nothing. But oh, she wanted to\n",
      "cling to something tangible, to love something living, something that\n",
      "one could hold against one’s heart, that one could see and touch and do\n",
      "things for. If her poor baby hadn’t died  babies didn’t get bored\n",
      "with one, it took them a long while to grow up and find one out. And\n",
      "perhaps one’s baby never did find one out; perhaps one would always be\n",
      "to it, however old and bearded it grew, somebody special, somebody\n",
      "different from every one else, and if for no other reason, precious in\n",
      "that one could never be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting with dim eyes looking out to sea she felt an extraordinary\n",
      "yearning to hold something of her very own tight to her bosom. Rose was\n",
      "slender, and as reserved in figure as in character, yet she felt a\n",
      "queer sensation of—how could she describe it?—bosom. There was\n",
      "something about San Salvatore that made her feel all bosom. She wanted\n",
      "to gather to her bosom, to comfort and protect, soothing the dear head\n",
      "that should lie on it with softest strokings and murmurs of love.\n",

      "semblance of happiness away from her, and given her nothing in\n",
      "exchange. Yes—it had given her yearnings in exchange, this ache and\n",
      "longing, this queer feeling of bosom; but that was worse than nothing.\n",
      "And she who had learned balance, who never at home was irritated but\n",

      "One would have supposed that such a little thing would not have touched\n",

      "back on long-stifled yearnings after Frederick, but also turned into\n",
      "somebody who wanted to fight over little things? After tea, when both\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had disappeared again—it was quite\n",

      "about his acceptance of her suggestion, for he had not waited to write\n",
      "a letter in answer to hers, but had telegraphed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, surely, was eager. It showed, Scrap thought, a definite wish for\n",
      "reunion; and watching his wife’s happy face, and aware of her desire\n",
      "that Mellersh should enjoy his holiday, she told herself that he would\n",
      "be a very unusual fool should he waste his time bothering about anybody\n",
      "else. “If he isn’t nice to her,” Scrap thought, “he shall be taken to\n",
      "the battlements and tipped over.” For, by the end of the week, she and\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins had become Caroline and Lotty to each other, and were\n",
      "friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilkins had always been friends, but Scrap had struggled not to\n",
      "be. She had tried hard to be cautious, but how difficult was caution\n",
      "with Mrs. Wilkins! Free herself from every vestige of it, she was so\n",
      "entirely unreserved, so completely expansive, that soon Scrap, almost\n",
      "before she knew what she was doing, was being unreserved too. And\n",
      "nobody could be more unreserved than Scrap, once she let herself go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only difficulty about Lotty was that she was nearly always\n",
      "somewhere else. You couldn’t catch her; you couldn’t pin her down to\n",
      "come and talk. Scrap’s fears that she would grab seemed grotesque in\n",
      "retrospect. Why, there was no grab in her. At dinner and after dinner\n",
      "were the only times one really saw her. All day long she was invisible,\n",
      "and would come back in the late afternoon looking a perfect sight, her\n",
      "hair full of bits of moss, and her freckles worse than ever. Perhaps\n",
      "she was making the most of her time before Mellersh arrived to do all\n",
      "the things she wanted to do, and meant to devote herself afterwards to\n",
      "going about with him, tidy and in her best clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap watched her, interested in spite of herself, because it seemed so\n",
      "extraordinary to be as happy as all that on so little. San Salvatore\n",
      "was beautiful, and the weather was divine; but scenery and weather had\n",
      "never been enough for Scrap, and how could they be enough for somebody\n",
      "who would have to leave them quite soon and go back to life in\n",
      "Hampstead? Also, there was the imminence of Mellersh, of that Mellersh\n",
      "from whom Lotty had so lately run. It was all very well to feel one\n",
      "ought to share, and to make a beau geste and do it, but the beaux\n",
      "gestes Scrap had known hadn’t made anybody happy. Nobody really liked\n",
      "being the object of one, and it always meant an effort on the part of\n",
      "the maker. Still, she had to admit there was no effort about Lotty; it\n",
      "was quite plain that everything she did and said was effortless, and\n",
      "that she was just simply, completely happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so Mrs. Wilkins was; for her doubts as to whether she had had time\n",
      "to become steady enough in serenity to go on being serene in Mellersh’s\n",
      "company when she had it uninterruptedly right round the clock, had gone\n",
      "by the middle of the week, and she felt that nothing now could shake\n",
      "her. She was ready for anything. She was firmly grafted, rooted, built\n",
      "into heaven. Whatever Mellersh said or did, she would not budge an inch\n",
      "out of heaven, would not rouse herself a single instant to come outside\n",
      "it and be cross. On the contrary, she was going to pull him up into it\n",
      "beside her, and they would sit comfortably together, suffused in light,\n",
      "and laugh at how much afraid of him she used to be in Hampstead, and at\n",
      "how deceitful her afraidness had made her. But he wouldn’t need much\n",
      "pulling. He would come in quite naturally after a day or two,\n",
      "irresistibly wafted on the scented breezes of that divine air; and\n",
      "there he would sit arrayed in stars, thought Mrs. Wilkins, in whose\n",
      "mind, among much other débris, floated occasional bright shreds of\n",
      "poetry. She laughed to herself a little at the picture of Mellersh,\n",
      "that top-hatted, black-coated, respectable family solicitor, arrayed in\n",
      "stars, but she laughed affectionately, almost with a maternal pride in\n",
      "how splendid he would look in such fine clothes. “Poor lamb,” she\n",
      "murmured to herself affectionately. And added, “What he wants is a\n",
      "thorough airing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was during the first half of the week. By the beginning of the\n",
      "last half, at the end of which Mr. Wilkins arrived, she left off even\n",
      "assuring herself that she was unshakeable, that she was permeated\n",
      "beyond altering by the atmosphere, she no longer thought of it or\n",
      "noticed it; she took it for granted. If one may say so, and she\n",
      "certainly said so, not only to herself but also to Lady Caroline, she\n",
      "had found her celestial legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to Mrs. Fisher’s idea of the seemly—but of course contrary;\n",
      "what else would one expect of Mrs. Wilkins?—she did not go to meet her\n",
      "husband at Mezzago, but merely walked down to the point where Beppo’s\n",
      "fly would leave him and his luggage in the street of Castagneto. Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher disliked the arrival of Mr. Wilkins, and was sure that anybody\n",
      "who could have married Mrs. Wilkins must be at least of an injudicious\n",
      "disposition, but a husband, whatever his disposition, should be\n",
      "properly met. Mr. Fisher had always been properly met. Never once in\n",
      "his married life had he gone unmet at a station, nor had he ever not\n",
      "been seen off. These observances, these courtesies, strengthened the\n",
      "bonds of marriage, and made the husband feel he could rely on his\n",
      "wife’s being always there. Always being there was the essential secret\n",
      "for a wife. What would have become of Mr. Fisher if she had neglected\n",
      "to act on this principle she preferred not to think. Enough things\n",
      "became of him as it was; for whatever one’s care in stopping up,\n",
      "married life yet seemed to contain chinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Wilkins took no pains. She just walked down the hill\n",
      "singing—Mrs. Fisher could hear her—and picked up her husband in the\n",
      "street as casually as if he were a pin. The three others, still in bed,\n",
      "for it was not nearly time to get up, heard her as she passed beneath\n",
      "their windows down the zigzag path to meet Mr. Wilkins, who was coming\n",
      "by the morning train, and Scrap smiled, and Rose sighed, and Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher rang her bell and desired Francesca to bring her her breakfast\n",
      "in her room. All three had breakfast that day in their rooms, moved by\n",
      "a common instinct to take cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap always breakfasted in bed, but she had the same instinct for\n",
      "cover, and during breakfast she made plans for spending the whole day\n",
      "where she was. Perhaps, though, it wouldn’t be as necessary that day as\n",
      "the next. That day, Scrap calculated, Mellersh would be provided for.\n",
      "He would want to have a bath, and having a bath at San Salvatore was an\n",
      "elaborate business, a real adventure if one had a hot one in the\n",
      "bathroom, and it took a lot of time. It involved the attendance of the\n",
      "entire staff—Domenico and the boy Giuseppe coaxing the patent stove to\n",
      "burn, restraining it when it burnt too fiercely, using the bellows to\n",
      "it when it threatened to go out, relighting it when it did go out;\n",
      "Francesca anxiously hovering over the tap regulating its trickle,\n",
      "because if it were turned on too full the water instantly ran cold, and\n",
      "if not full enough the stove blew up inside and mysteriously flooded\n",
      "the house; and Costanza and Angela running up and down bringing pails\n",
      "of hot water from the kitchen to eke out what the tap did.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bath had been put in lately, and was at once the pride and the\n",
      "terror of the servants. It was very patent. Nobody quite understood it.\n",
      "There were long printed instructions as to its right treatment hanging\n",
      "on the wall, in which the word pericoloso recurred. When Mrs. Fisher,\n",
      "proceeding on her arrival to the bathroom, saw this word, she went back\n",
      "to her room again and ordered a sponge-bath instead; and when the\n",
      "others found what using the bathroom meant, and how reluctant the\n",
      "servants were to leave them alone with the stove, and how Francesca\n",
      "positively refused to, and stayed with her back turned watching the\n",
      "tap, and how the remaining servants waited anxiously outside the door\n",
      "till the bather came safely out again, they too had sponge-baths\n",
      "brought into their rooms instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins, however, was a man, and would be sure to want a big bath.\n",
      "Having it, Scrap calculated, would keep him busy for a long while. Then\n",
      "he would unpack, and then, after his night in the train, he would\n",
      "probably sleep till the evening. So would he be provided for the whole\n",
      "of that day, and not be let loose on them till dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Scrap came to the conclusion she would be quite safe in the\n",
      "garden that day, and got up as usual after breakfast, and dawdled as\n",
      "usual through her dressing, listening with a slightly cocked ear to\n",
      "the sounds of Mr. Wilkins’s arrival, of his luggage being carried into\n",
      "Lotty’s room on the other side of the landing, of his educated voice\n",
      "as he inquired of Lotty, first, “Do I give this fellow anything?” and\n",
      "immediately afterwards, “Can I have a hot bath?”—of Lotty’s voice\n",
      "cheerfully assuring him that he needn’t give the fellow anything\n",
      "because he was the gardener, and that yes, he could have a hot bath;\n",
      "and soon after this the landing was filled with the familiar noises of\n",
      "wood being brought, of water being brought, of feet running, of tongues\n",
      "vociferating—in fact, with the preparation of the bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap finished dressing, and then loitered at her window, waiting till\n",
      "she should hear Mr. Wilkins go into the bathroom. When he was safely\n",
      "there she would slip out and settle herself in her garden and resume\n",
      "her inquiries into the probable meaning of her life. She was getting on\n",
      "with her inquiries. She dozed much less frequently, and was beginning\n",
      "to be inclined to agree that tawdry was the word to apply to her past.\n",
      "Also she was afraid that her future looked black.\n",
      "\n",
      "There—she could hear Mr. Wilkins’s educated voice again. Lotty’s door\n",
      "had opened, and he was coming out of it asking his way to the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s where you see the crowd,” Lotty’s voice answered—still a cheerful\n",
      "voice, Scrap was glad to notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "His steps went along the landing, and Lotty’s steps seemed to go\n",
      "downstairs, and then there seemed to be a brief altercation at the\n",
      "bathroom door—hardly so much an altercation as a chorus of\n",
      "vociferations on one side and a wordless determination, Scrap judged, to\n",
      "have a bath by oneself on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins knew no Italian, and the expression pericoloso left\n",
      "him precisely as it found him—or would have if he had seen it, but\n",
      "naturally he took no notice of the printed matter on the wall. He\n",
      "firmly closed the door on the servants, resisting Domenico, who tried\n",
      "to the last to press through, and locked himself in as a man should for\n",
      "his bath, judicially considering, as he made his simple preparations\n",
      "for getting in, the singular standard of behaviour of these foreigners\n",
      "who, both male and female, apparently wished to stay with him while\n",
      "he bathed. In Finland, he had heard, the female natives not only\n",
      "were present on such occasions but actually washed the bath-taking\n",
      "traveller. He had not heard, however, that this was true too of Italy,\n",
      "which somehow seemed much nearer civilisation—perhaps because one went\n",
      "there, and did not go to Finland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impartially examining this reflection, and carefully balancing the\n",
      "claims to civilisation of Italy and Finland, Mr. Wilkins got into the\n",
      "bath and turned off the tap. Naturally he turned off the tap. It was\n",
      "what one did. But on the instructions, printed in red letters, was a\n",
      "paragraph saying that the tap should not be turned off as long as there\n",
      "was still fire in the stove. It should be left on—not much on, but\n",
      "on—until the fire was quite out; otherwise, and here again was the word\n",
      "pericoloso, the stove would blow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins got into the bath, turned off the tap, and the stove blew\n",
      "up, exactly as the printed instructions said it would. It blew up,\n",
      "fortunately, only in its inside, but it blew up with a terrific noise,\n",
      "and Mr. Wilkins leapt out of the bath and rushed to the door, and only\n",
      "the instinct born of years of training made him snatch up a towel as he\n",
      "rushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap, half-way across the landing on her way out of doors, heard the\n",
      "explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens,” she thought, remembering the instructions, “there goes\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she ran toward the head of the stairs to call the servants, and as\n",
      "she ran, out ran Mr. Wilkins clutching his towel, and they ran into\n",
      "each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That damned bath!” cried Mr. Wilkins, perhaps for the only time in his\n",
      "life forgetting himself; but he was upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was an introduction. Mr Wilkins, imperfectly concealed in his\n",
      "towel, his shoulders exposed at one end and his legs at the other, and\n",
      "Lady Caroline Dester, to meet whom he had swallowed all his anger with\n",
      "his wife and come out to Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Lotty in her letter had told him who was at San Salvatore besides\n",
      "herself and Mrs. Arbuthnot, and Mr. Wilkins at once had perceived that\n",
      "this was an opportunity which might never recur. Lotty had merely said,\n",
      "“There are two other women here, Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline Dester,”\n",
      "but that was enough. He knew all about the Droitwiches, their wealth,\n",
      "their connections, their place in history, and the power they had,\n",
      "should they choose to exert it, of making yet another solicitor happy\n",
      "by adding him to those they already employed. Some people employed one\n",
      "solicitor for one branch of their affairs, and another for another. The\n",
      "affairs of the Droitwiches must have many branches. He had also\n",
      "heard—for it was, he considered, part of his business to hear, and\n",
      "having heard to remember—of the beauty of their only daughter. Even if\n",
      "the Droitwiches themselves did not need his services, their daughter\n",
      "might. Beauty led one into strange situations; advice could never come\n",
      "amiss. And should none of them, neither parents nor daughter nor any of\n",
      "their brilliant sons, need him in his professional capacity, it yet was\n",
      "obviously a most valuable acquaintance to make. It opened up vistas. It\n",
      "swelled with possibilities. He might go on living in Hampstead for\n",
      "years, and not again come across such another chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly his wife’s letter reached him he telegraphed and packed. This\n",
      "was business. He was not a man to lose time when it came to business;\n",
      "nor was he a man to jeopardise a chance by neglecting to be amiable. He\n",
      "met his wife perfectly amiably, aware that amiability under such\n",
      "circumstances was wisdom. Besides, he actually felt amiable—very. For\n",
      "once, Lotty was really helping him. He kissed her affectionately on\n",
      "getting out of Beppo’s fly, and was afraid she must have got up\n",
      "extremely early; he made no complaints of the steepness of the walk up;\n",
      "he told her pleasantly of his journey, and when called upon, obediently\n",
      "admired the views. It was all neatly mapped out in his mind, what he\n",
      "was going to do that first day—have a shave, have a bath, put on clean\n",
      "clothes, sleep a while, and then would come lunch and the introduction\n",
      "to Lady Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the train he had selected the words of his greeting, going over them\n",
      "with care—some slight expression of his gratification in meeting one of\n",
      "whom he, in common with the whole world, had heard—but of course put\n",
      "delicately, very delicately; some slight reference to her distinguished\n",
      "parents and the part her family had played in the history of\n",
      "England—made, of course, with proper tact; a sentence or two about her\n",
      "eldest brother Lord Winchcombe, who had won his V.C. in the late war\n",
      "under circumstances which could only cause—he might or might not add\n",
      "this—every Englishman’s heart to beat higher than ever with pride, and\n",
      "the first steps towards what might well be the turning-point in his\n",
      "career would have been taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here he was  no, it was too terrible, what could be more\n",
      "terrible? Only a towel on, water running off his legs, and that\n",
      "exclamation. He knew at once the lady was Lady Caroline—the minute the\n",
      "exclamation was out he knew it. Rarely did Mr. Wilkins use that word,\n",
      "and never, never in the presence of a lady or a client. While as for\n",
      "the towel—why had he come? Why had he not stayed in Hampstead? It would\n",
      "be impossible to live this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Wilkins was reckoning without Scrap. She, indeed, screwed up\n",
      "her face at the first flash of him on her astonished sight in an\n",
      "enormous effort not to laugh, and having choked the laughter down and\n",
      "got her face serious again, she said as composedly as if he had had all\n",
      "his clothes on, “How do you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What perfect tact. Mr. Wilkins could have worshipped her. This\n",
      "exquisite ignoring. Blue blood, of course, coming out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwhelmed with gratitude he took her offered hand and said “How do\n",
      "you do,” in his turn, and merely to repeat the ordinary words seemed\n",
      "magically to restore the situation to the normal. Indeed, he was so\n",
      "much relieved, and it was so natural to be shaking hands, to be\n",
      "conventionally greeting, that he forgot he had only a towel on and his\n",
      "professional manner came back to him. He forgot what he was looking\n",
      "like, but he did not forget that this was Lady Caroline Dester, the\n",
      "lady he had come all the way to Italy to see, and he did not forget\n",
      "that it was in her face, her lovely and important face, that he had\n",
      "flung his terrible exclamation. He must at once entreat her\n",
      "forgiveness. To say such a word to a lady—to any lady, but of all\n",
      "ladies to just this one \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I used unpardonable language,” began Mr. Wilkins very\n",
      "earnestly, as earnestly and ceremoniously as if he had had his clothes\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it most appropriate,” said Scrap, who was used to damns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins was incredibly relieved and soothed by this answer. No\n",
      "offence, then, taken. Blue blood again. Only blue blood could afford\n",
      "such a liberal, such an understanding attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is Lady Caroline Dester, is it not, to whom I am speaking?” he\n",
      "asked, his voice sounding even more carefully cultivated than usual,\n",
      "for he had to restrain too much pleasure, too much relief, too much of\n",
      "the joy of the pardoned and the shriven from getting into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Scrap; and for the life of her she couldn’t help smiling.\n",
      "She couldn’t help it. She hadn’t meant to smile at Mr. Wilkins, not\n",
      "ever; but really he looked—and then his voice on the top of the rest\n",
      "of him, oblivious of the towel and his legs, and talking just like a\n",
      "church.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Allow me to introduce myself,” said Mr. Wilkins, with the ceremony of\n",
      "the drawing-room. “My name is Mellersh-Wilkins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And he instinctively held out his hand a second time at the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought perhaps it was,” said Scrap, a second time having hers\n",
      "shaken and a second time unable not to smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to proceed to the first of the graceful tributes he had\n",
      "prepared in the train, oblivious, as he could not see himself, that he\n",
      "was without his clothes, when the servants came running up the stairs\n",
      "and, simultaneously, Mrs. Fisher appeared in the doorway of her\n",
      "sitting-room. For all this had happened very quickly, and the servants\n",
      "away in the kitchen, and Mrs. Fisher pacing her battlements, had not\n",
      "had time on hearing the noise to appear before the second handshake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants when they heard the dreaded noise knew at once what had\n",
      "happened, and rushed straight into the bathroom to try and staunch the\n",
      "flood, taking no notice of the figure on the landing in the towel, but\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher did not know what the noise could be, and coming out of her\n",
      "room to inquire stood rooted on the door-sill.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was enough to root anybody. Lady Caroline shaking hands with what\n",
      "evidently, if he had had clothes on, would have been Mrs. Wilkins’s\n",
      "husband, and both of them conversing just as if—\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Scrap became aware of Mrs. Fisher. She turned to her at once. “Do\n",
      "let me,” she said gracefully, “introduce Mr. Mellersh-Wilkins. He has\n",
      "just come. This,” she added, turning to Mr. Wilkins, “is Mrs. Fisher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Wilkins, nothing if not courteous, reacted at once to the\n",
      "conventional formula. First he bowed to the elderly lady in the\n",
      "doorway, then he crossed over to her, his wet feet leaving footprints\n",

      "“It is a pleasure,” said Mr. Wilkins in his carefully modulated voice,\n",
      "“to meet a friend of my wife’s.”\n",

      "The strange effect of this incident was that when they met that evening\n",
      "at dinner both Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had a singular feeling of\n",
      "secret understanding with Mr. Wilkins. He could not be to them as other\n",
      "men. He could not be to them as he would have been if they had met him\n",
      "in his clothes. There was a sense of broken ice; they felt at once\n",
      "intimate and indulgent; almost they felt to him as nurses do—as those\n",
      "feel who have assisted either patients or young children at their\n",
      "baths. They were acquainted with Mr. Wilkins’s legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Mrs. Fisher said to him that morning in her first shock will never\n",
      "be known, but what Mr. Wilkins said to her in reply, when reminded by\n",
      "what she was saying of his condition, was so handsome in its apology,\n",
      "so proper in its confusion, that she had ended by being quite sorry for\n",
      "him and completely placated. After all, it was an accident, and nobody\n",
      "could help accidents. And when she saw him next at dinner, dressed,\n",
      "polished, spotless as to linen and sleek as to hair, she felt this\n",
      "singular sensation of a secret understanding with him and, added to it,\n",
      "of a kind of almost personal pride in his appearance, now that he was\n",
      "dressed, which presently extended in some subtle way to an almost\n",
      "personal pride in everything he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no doubt whatever in Mrs. Fisher’s mind that a man was\n",
      "infinitely preferable as a companion to a woman. Mr. Wilkins’s presence\n",
      "and conversation at once raised the standard of the dinner-table from\n",
      "that of a bear garden—yes, a bear garden—to that of a civilised social\n",
      "gathering. He talked as men talk, about interesting subjects, and,\n",
      "though most courteous to Lady Caroline, showed no traces of dissolving\n",
      "into simpers and idiocy whenever he addressed her. He was, indeed,\n",
      "precisely as courteous to Mrs. Fisher herself; and when for the first\n",
      "time at that table politics were introduced, he listened to her with\n",
      "the proper seriousness on her exhibiting a desire to speak, and treated\n",
      "her opinions with the attention they deserved. He appeared to think\n",
      "much as she did about Lloyd George, and in regard to literature he was\n",
      "equally sound. In fact there was real conversation, and he liked nuts.\n",
      "How he could have married Mrs. Wilkins was a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty, for her part, looked on with round eyes. She had expected\n",
      "Mellersh to take at least two days before he got to this stage, but the\n",
      "San Salvatore spell had worked instantly. It was not only that he was\n",
      "pleasant at dinner, for she had always seen him pleasant at dinners\n",
      "with other people, but he had been pleasant all day privately—so\n",
      "pleasant that he had complimented her on her looks while she was\n",
      "brushing out her hair, and kissed her. Kissed her! And it was neither\n",
      "good-morning nor good-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, this being so, she would put off telling him the truth about her\n",
      "nest-egg, and about Rose not being his hostess after all, till next\n",
      "day. Pity to spoil things. She had been going to blurt it out as soon\n",
      "as he had had a rest, but it did seem a pity to disturb such a very\n",
      "beautiful frame of mind as that of Mellersh this first day. Let him too\n",
      "get more firmly fixed in heaven. Once fixed he wouldn’t mind anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face sparkled with delight at the instantaneous effect of San\n",
      "Salvatore. Even the catastrophe of the bath, of which she had been told\n",
      "when she came in from the garden, had not shaken him. Of course all\n",
      "that he had needed was a holiday. What a brute she had been to him when\n",
      "he wanted to take her himself to Italy. But this arrangement, as it\n",
      "happened, was ever so much better, though not through any merit of\n",
      "hers. She talked and laughed gaily, not a shred of fear of him left in\n",
      "her, and even when she said, struck by his spotlessness, that he looked\n",
      "so clean that one could eat one’s dinner off him, and Scrap laughed,\n",
      "Mellersh laughed too. He would have minded that at home, supposing that\n",
      "at home she had had the spirit to say it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a successful evening. Scrap, whenever she looked at Mr. Wilkins,\n",
      "saw him in his towel, dripping water, and felt indulgent. Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "was delighted with him. Rose was a dignified hostess in Mr. Wilkins’s\n",
      "eyes, quiet and dignified, and he admired the way she waived her right\n",
      "to preside at the head of the table—as a graceful compliment, of\n",
      "course, to Mrs. Fisher’s age. Mrs. Arbuthnot was, opined Mr. Wilkins,\n",
      "naturally retiring. She was the most retiring of the three ladies. He\n",
      "had met her before dinner alone for a moment in the drawing-room, and\n",
      "had expressed in appropriate language his sense of her kindness in\n",
      "wishing him to join her party, and she had been retiring. Was she shy?\n",
      "Probably. She had blushed, and murmured as if in deprecation, and then\n",
      "the others had come in. At dinner she talked least. He would, of\n",
      "course, become better acquainted with her during the next few days, and\n",
      "it would be a pleasure, he was sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Lady Caroline was all and more than all Mr. Wilkins had\n",
      "imagined, and had received his speeches, worked in skilfully between\n",
      "the courses, graciously; Mrs. Fisher was the exact old lady he had been\n",
      "hoping to come across all his professional life; and Lotty had not only\n",
      "immensely improved, but was obviously au mieux—Mr. Wilkins knew what\n",
      "was necessary in French—with Lady Caroline. He had been much tormented\n",
      "during the day by the thought of how he had stood conversing with Lady\n",
      "Caroline forgetful of his not being dressed, and had at last written\n",
      "her a note most deeply apologising, and beseeching her to overlook his\n",
      "amazing, his incomprehensible obliviousness, to which she had replied\n",
      "in pencil on the back of the envelope, “Don’t worry.” And he had obeyed\n",
      "her commands, and had put it from him. The result was he was now in\n",
      "great contentment. Before going to sleep that night he pinched his\n",
      "wife’s ear. She was amazed. These endearments \n",
      "\n",
      "What is more, the morning brought no relapse in Mr. Wilkins, and he\n",
      "kept up to this high level throughout the day, in spite of its being\n",
      "the first day of the second week, and therefore pay day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its being pay day precipitated Lotty’s confession, which she had, when\n",
      "it came to the point, been inclined to put off a little longer. She was\n",
      "not afraid, she dared anything, but Mellersh was in such an admirable\n",
      "humour—why risk clouding it just yet? When, however, soon after\n",
      "breakfast Costanza appeared with a pile of very dirty little bits of\n",
      "paper covered with sums in pencil, and having knocked at Mrs. Fisher’s\n",
      "door and been sent away, and at Lady Caroline’s door and been sent\n",
      "away, and at Rose’s door and had no answer because Rose had gone out,\n",
      "she waylaid Lotty, who was showing Mellersh over the house, and pointed\n",
      "to the bits of paper and talked very rapidly and loud, and shrugged her\n",
      "shoulders a great deal, and kept on pointing at the bits of paper,\n",
      "Lotty remembered that a week had passed without anybody paying anything\n",
      "to anyone, and that the moment had come to settle up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does this good lady want something?” inquired Mr. Wilkins\n",
      "mellifluously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Money,” said Lotty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Money?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the housekeeping bills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you have nothing to do with those,” said Mr. Wilkins serenely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, I have—”\n",
      "\n",
      "And the confession was precipitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was wonderful how Mellersh took it. One would have imagined that his\n",
      "sole idea about the nest-egg had always been that it should be lavished\n",
      "on just this. He did not, as he would have done at home, cross-examine\n",
      "her; he accepted everything as it came pouring out, about her fibs and\n",
      "all, and when she had finished and said, “You have every right to be\n",
      "angry, I think, but I hope you won’t be and will forgive me instead,”\n",
      "he merely asked, “What can be more beneficial than such a holiday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon she put her arm through his and held it tight and said, “Oh,\n",
      "Mellersh, you really are too sweet!”—her face red with pride in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he should so quickly assimilate the atmosphere, that he should at\n",
      "once become nothing but kindness, showed surely what a real affinity he\n",
      "had with good and beautiful things. He belonged quite naturally in this\n",
      "place of heavenly calm. He was—extraordinary how she had misjudged\n",
      "him—by nature a child of light. Fancy not minding the dreadful fibs she\n",
      "had gone in for before leaving home; fancy passing even those over\n",
      "without comment. Wonderful. Yet not wonderful, for wasn’t he in heaven?\n",
      "In heaven nobody minded any of those done-with things, one didn’t even\n",
      "trouble to forgive and forget, one was much too happy. She pressed his\n",
      "arm tight in her gratitude and appreciation; and though he did not\n",
      "withdraw his, neither did he respond to her pressure. Mr. Wilkins was\n",
      "of a cool habit, and rarely had any real wish to press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Costanza, perceiving that she had lost the Wilkinses’ ear\n",
      "had gone back to Mrs. Fisher, who at least understood Italian, besides\n",
      "being clearly in the servants’ eyes the one of the party marked down by\n",
      "age and appearance to pay the bills; and to her, while Mrs. Fisher put\n",
      "the final touches to her toilette, for she was preparing, by means of\n",
      "putting on a hat and veil and feather boa and gloves, to go for her\n",
      "first stroll in the lower garden—positively her first since her\n",
      "arrival—she explained that unless she was given money to pay the last\n",
      "week’s bills the shops of Castagneto would refuse credit for the\n",
      "current week’s food. Not even credit would they give, affirmed\n",
      "Costanza, who had been spending a great deal and was anxious to pay all\n",
      "her relations what was owed them and also to find out how her\n",
      "mistresses took it, for that day’s meals. Soon it would be the hour of\n",
      "colazione, and how could there be colazione without meat, without\n",
      "fish, without eggs, without—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher took the bills out of her hand and looked at the total; and\n",
      "she was so much astonished by its size, so much horrified by the\n",
      "extravagance to which it testified, that she sat down at her\n",
      "writing-table to go into the thing thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza had a very bad half-hour. She had not supposed it was in the\n",
      "English to be so mercenary. And then la Vecchia, as she was called in\n",
      "the kitchen, knew so much Italian, and with a doggedness that filled\n",
      "Costanza with shame on her behalf, for such conduct was the last one\n",
      "expected from the noble English, she went through item after item,\n",
      "requiring and persisting till she got them, explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no explanations, except that Costanza had had one glorious\n",
      "week of doing exactly as she chose, of splendid unbridled licence, and\n",
      "that this was the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza, having no explanations, wept. It was miserable to think she\n",
      "would have to cook from now on under watchfulness, under suspicion; and\n",
      "what would her relations say when they found the orders they received\n",
      "were whittled down? They would say she had no influence; they would\n",
      "despise her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza wept, but Mrs. Fisher was unmoved. In slow and splendid\n",
      "Italian, with the roll of the cantos of the Inferno, she informed her\n",
      "that she would pay no bills till the following week, and that meanwhile\n",
      "the food was to be precisely as good as ever, and at a quarter the\n",
      "cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costanza threw up her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next week, proceeded Mrs. Fisher unmoved, if she found this had been so\n",
      "she would pay the whole. Otherwise—she paused; for what she would do\n",
      "otherwise she did not know herself. But she paused and looked\n",
      "impenetrable, majestic and menacing, and Costanza was cowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Fisher, having dismissed her with a gesture, went in search\n",
      "of Lady Caroline to complain. She had been under the impression that\n",
      "Lady Caroline ordered the meals and therefore was responsible for the\n",
      "prices, but now it appeared that the cook had been left to do exactly\n",
      "as she pleased ever since they got there, which of course was simply\n",
      "disgraceful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap was not in her bedroom, but the room, on Mrs. Fisher’s opening\n",
      "the door, for she suspected her of being in it and only pretending not\n",
      "to hear the knock, was still flowerlike from her presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scent,” sniffed Mrs. Fisher, shutting it again; and she wished Carlyle\n",
      "could have had five minutes’ straight talk with this young woman. And\n",
      "yet—perhaps even he—\n",
      "\n",
      "She went downstairs to go into the garden in search of her, and in the\n",
      "hall encountered Mr. Wilkins. He had his hat on, and was lighting a\n",
      "cigar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indulgent as Mrs. Fisher felt towards Mr. Wilkins, and peculiarly and\n",
      "even mystically related after the previous morning’s encounter, she yet\n",
      "could not like a cigar in the house. Out of doors she endured it, but\n",
      "it was not necessary, when out of doors was such a big place, to\n",
      "indulge the habit indoors. Even Mr. Fisher, who had been, she should\n",
      "say, a man originally tenacious of habits, had quite soon after\n",
      "marriage got out of this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Mr. Wilkins, snatching off his hat on seeing her, instantly\n",
      "threw the cigar away. He threw it into the water a great jar of arum\n",
      "lilies presumably contained, and Mrs. Fisher, aware of the value men\n",
      "attach to their newly-lit cigars, could not but be impressed by this\n",
      "immediate and magnificent amende honorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the cigar did not reach the water. It got caught in the lilies, and\n",
      "smoked on by itself among them, a strange and depraved-looking object.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are you going to, my prett—” began Mr. Wilkins, advancing\n",
      "towards Mrs. Fisher; but he broke off just in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it morning spirits impelling him to address Mrs. Fisher in the\n",
      "terms of a nursery rhyme? He wasn’t even aware that he knew the thing.\n",
      "Most strange. What could have put it, at such a moment, into his\n",
      "self-possessed head? He felt great respect for Mrs. Fisher, and would\n",
      "not for the world have insulted her by addressing her as a maid, pretty\n",
      "or otherwise. He wished to stand well with her. She was a woman of\n",
      "parts, and also, he suspected, of property. At breakfast they had been\n",
      "most pleasant together, and he had been struck by her apparent intimacy\n",
      "with well-known persons. Victorians, of course; but it was restful to\n",
      "talk about them after the strain of his brother-in-law’s Georgian\n",
      "parties on Hampstead Heath. He and she were getting on famously, he\n",
      "felt. She already showed all the symptoms of presently wishing to\n",
      "become a client. Not for the world would he offend her. He turned a\n",
      "little cold at the narrowness of his escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not, however, noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going out,” he said very politely, all readiness should she\n",
      "confirm his assumption to accompany her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to find Lady Caroline,” said Mrs. Fisher, going towards the\n",
      "glass door leading into the top garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An agreeable quest,” remarked Mr. Wilkins. “May I assist in the\n",
      "search? Allow me—” he added, opening the door for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She usually sits over in that corner behind the bushes,” said Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher. “And I don’t know about it being an agreeable quest. She has\n",
      "been letting the bills run up in the most terrible fashion, and needs a\n",
      "good scolding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lady Caroline?” said Mr. Wilkins, unable to follow such an attitude.\n",
      "“What has Lady Caroline, if I may inquire, to do with the bills here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The housekeeping was left to her, and as we all share alike it ought\n",
      "to have been a matter of honour with her—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—Lady Caroline housekeeping for the party here? A party which\n",
      "includes my wife? My dear lady, you render me speechless. Do you not\n",
      "know she is the daughter of the Droitwiches?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, is that who she is,” said Mrs. Fisher, scrunching heavily over the\n",
      "pebbles towards the hidden corner. “Well, that accounts for it. The\n",
      "muddle that man Droitwich made in his department in the war was a\n",
      "national scandal. It amounted to misappropriation of the public funds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is impossible, I assure you, to expect the daughter of the\n",
      "Droitwiches—” began Mr. Wilkins earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Droitwiches,” interrupted Mrs. Fisher, “are neither here nor\n",
      "there. Duties undertaken should be performed. I don’t intend my money\n",
      "to be squandered for the sake of any Droitwiches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A headstrong old lady. Perhaps not so easy to deal with as he had\n",
      "hoped. But how wealthy. Only the consciousness of great wealth would\n",
      "make her snap her fingers in this manner at the Droitwiches. Lotty, on\n",
      "being questioned, had been vague about her circumstances, and had\n",
      "described her house as a mausoleum with gold-fish swimming about in it;\n",
      "but now he was sure she was more than very well off. Still, he wished\n",
      "he had not joined her at this moment, for he had no sort of desire to\n",
      "be present at such a spectacle as the scolding of Lady Caroline Dester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, however, he was reckoning without Scrap. Whatever she felt when\n",
      "she looked up and beheld Mr. Wilkins discovering her corner on the very\n",
      "first morning, nothing but angelicness appeared on her face. She took\n",
      "her feet off the parapet on Mrs. Fisher’s sitting down on it, and\n",
      "listening gravely to her opening remarks as to her not having any money\n",
      "to fling about in reckless and uncontrolled household expenditure,\n",
      "interrupted her flow by pulling one of the cushions from behind her\n",
      "head and offering it to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit on this,” said Scrap, holding it out. “You’ll be more\n",
      "comfortable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins leapt to relieve her of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thanks,” said Mrs. Fisher, interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult to get into the swing again. Mr. Wilkins inserted the\n",
      "cushion solicitously between the slightly raised Mrs. Fisher and the\n",
      "stone of the parapet, and again she had to say “Thanks.” It was\n",
      "interrupted. Besides, Lady Caroline said nothing in her defence; she\n",
      "only looked at her, and listened with the face of an attentive angel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Mr. Wilkins that it must be difficult to scold a Dester\n",
      "who looked like that and so exquisitely said nothing. Mrs. Fisher, he\n",
      "was glad to see, gradually found it difficult herself, for her severity\n",
      "slackened, and she ended by saying lamely, “You ought to have told me\n",
      "you were not doing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know you thought I was,” said the lovely voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would now like to know,” said Mrs. Fisher, “what you propose to do\n",
      "for the rest of the time here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Scrap, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing? Do you mean to say—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I may be allowed, ladies,” interposed Mr. Wilkins in his suavest\n",
      "professional manner, “to make a suggestion”—they both looked at him,\n",
      "and remembering him as they first saw him felt indulgent—“I would\n",
      "advise you not to spoil a delightful holiday with worries over\n",
      "housekeeping.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Mrs. Fisher. “It is what I intend to avoid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most sensible,” said Mr. Wilkins. “Why not, then,” he continued,\n",
      "“allow the cook—an excellent cook, by the way—so much a head per\n",
      "diem”—Mr. Wilkins knew what was necessary in Latin—“and tell her that\n",
      "for this sum she must cater for you, and not only cater but cater as\n",
      "well as ever? One could easily reckon it out. The charges of a moderate\n",
      "hotel, for instance, would do as a basis, halved, or perhaps even\n",
      "quartered.”\n",
      "\n",

      "only deceiving themselves; but how deplorable were the results. She\n",
      "herself had grown old as people should grow old—steadily and firmly. No\n",
      "interruptions, no belated after-glows and spasmodic returns. If, after\n",
      "all these years, she were now going to be deluded into some sort of\n",
      "unsuitable breaking-out, how humiliating.\n",
      "\n",

      "there. It would be most unpleasant, should anything different occur in\n",

      "should continue (of course with dignity) to develop, however old one\n",
      "may be. She had nothing against developing, against further ripeness,\n",
      "because as long as one was alive one was not dead—obviously, decided\n",

      "Fisher’s head. Never in her life before had she thought of her maids,\n",
      "or of anybody else, as dusty old things. Her maids were not dusty old\n",

      "She allowed him to arrange the cushions because she instantly had\n",
      "discovered, the very first five minutes of the very first evening, that\n",
      "her fears lest he should cling to her and stare in dreadful admiration\n",
      "were baseless. Mr. Wilkins did not admire like that. It was not only,\n",
      "she instinctively felt, not in him, but if it had been he would not\n",
      "have dared to in her case. He was all respectfulness. She could direct\n",
      "his movements in regard to herself with the raising of an eyelash. His\n",
      "one concern was to obey. She had been prepared to like him if he would\n",
      "only be so obliging as not to admire her, and she did like him. She did\n",
      "not forget his moving defencelessness the first morning in his towel,\n",
      "and he amused her, and he was kind to Lotty. It is true she liked him\n",
      "most when he wasn’t there, but then she usually liked everybody most\n",
      "when they weren’t there. Certainly he did seem to be one of those men,\n",
      "rare in her experience, who never looked at a woman from the predatory\n",
      "angle. The comfort of this, the simplification it brought into the\n",
      "relations of the party, was immense. From this point of view Mr.\n",
      "Wilkins was simply ideal; he was unique and precious. Whenever she\n",
      "thought of him, and was perhaps inclined to dwell on the aspects of him\n",
      "that were a little boring, she remembered this and murmured, “But what\n",
      "a treasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed it was Mr. Wilkins’s one aim during his stay at San Salvatore to\n",
      "be a treasure. At all costs the three ladies who were not his wife must\n",
      "like him and trust him. Then presently when trouble arose in their\n",
      "lives—and in what lives did not trouble sooner or later arise?—they\n",
      "would recollect how reliable he was and how sympathetic, and turn to\n",
      "him for advice. Ladies with something on their minds were exactly what\n",
      "he wanted. Lady Caroline, he judged, had nothing on hers at the moment,\n",
      "but so much beauty—for he could not but see what was evident—must have\n",
      "had its difficulties in the past and would have more of them before it\n",
      "had done. In the past he had not been at hand; in the future he hoped\n",
      "to be. And meanwhile the behaviour of Mrs. Fisher, the next in\n",
      "importance of the ladies from the professional point of view, showed\n",
      "definite promise. It was almost certain that Mrs. Fisher had something\n",
      "on her mind. He had been observing her attentively, and it was almost\n",
      "certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the third, with Mrs. Arbuthnot, he had up to this made least\n",
      "headway, for she was so very retiring and quiet. But might not this\n",
      "very retiringness, this tendency to avoid the others and spend her time\n",
      "alone, indicate that she too was troubled? If so, he was her man. He\n",
      "would cultivate her. He would follow her and sit with her, and\n",
      "encourage her to tell him about herself. Arbuthnot, he understood from\n",
      "Lotty, was a British Museum official—nothing specially important at\n",
      "present, but Mr. Wilkins regarded it as his business to know all sorts\n",
      "and kinds. Besides, there was promotion. Arbuthnot, promoted, might\n",
      "become very much worth while.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Lotty, she was charming. She really had all the qualities he had\n",
      "credited her with during his courtship, and they had been, it appeared,\n",
      "merely in abeyance since. His early impressions of her were now being\n",
      "endorsed by the affection and even admiration Lady Caroline showed for\n",
      "her. Lady Caroline Dester was the last person, he was sure, to be\n",
      "mistaken on such a subject. Her knowledge of the world, her constant\n",
      "association with only the best, must make her quite unerring. Lotty was\n",
      "evidently, then, that which before marriage he had believed her to\n",
      "be—she was valuable. She certainly had been most valuable in\n",
      "introducing him to Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher. A man in his\n",
      "profession could be immensely helped by a clever and attractive wife.\n",
      "Why had she not been attractive sooner? Why this sudden flowering?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins began too to believe there was something peculiar, as Lotty\n",
      "had almost at once informed him, in the atmosphere of San Salvatore. It\n",
      "promoted expansion. It brought out dormant qualities. And feeling more\n",
      "and more pleased, and even charmed, by his wife, and very content with\n",
      "the progress he was making with the two others, and hopeful of progress\n",
      "to be made with the retiring third, Mr. Wilkins could not remember ever\n",
      "having had such an agreeable holiday. The only thing that might perhaps\n",
      "be bettered was the way they would call him Mr. Wilkins. Nobody said\n",
      "Mr. Mellersh-Wilkins. Yet he had introduced himself to Lady Caroline—he\n",
      "flinched a little on remembering the circumstances—as Mellersh-Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this was a small matter, not enough to worry about. He would be\n",
      "foolish if in such a place and such society he worried about anything.\n",
      "He was not even worrying about what the holiday was costing, and had\n",
      "made up his mind to pay not only his own expenses but his wife’s as\n",
      "well, and surprise her at the end by presenting her with her nest-egg\n",
      "as intact as when she started; and just the knowledge that he was\n",
      "preparing a happy surprise for her made him feel warmer than ever\n",
      "towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact Mr. Wilkins, who had begun by being consciously and according\n",
      "to plan on his best behaviour, remained on it unconsciously, and with\n",
      "no effort at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "And meanwhile the beautiful golden days were dropping gently from the\n",

      "the scent of beanfields in flower on the hillside behind the village\n",
      "came across to San Salvatore whenever the air moved. In the garden that\n",
      "second week the poet’s eyed narcissus disappeared out the long grass at\n",
      "the edge of the zigzag path, and wild gladiolus, slender and\n",
      "rose-coloured, came in their stead, white pinks bloomed in the borders,\n",
      "filling the whole place with their smoky-sweet smell, and a bush nobody\n",
      "had noticed burst into glory and fragrance, and it was a purple lilac\n",
      "bush. Such a jumble of spring and summer was not to be believed in,\n",
      "except by those who dwelt in those gardens. Everything seemed to be out\n",
      "together—all the things crowded into one month which in England are\n",

      "\n",
      "In case she should again hesitate and not post the letter, she gave it\n",
      "to Domenico to post; for if she did not write now there would be no\n",
      "time left at all. Half the month at San Salvatore was over. Even if\n",
      "Frederick started directly he got the letter, which of course he\n",

      "\n",

      "bother to answer. And if he did answer, it would just be giving some\n",
      "reason which was not true, and about being too busy to get away; and\n",

      "What things one did when one was idle. This resurrection of Frederick,\n",
      "or rather this attempt to resurrect him, what was it but the result of\n",
      "having nothing whatever to do? She wished she had never come away on a\n",
      "holiday. What did she want with holidays? Work was her salvation; work\n",
      "was the only thing that protected one, that kept one steady and one’s\n",
      "values true. At home in Hampstead, absorbed and busy, she had managed\n",
      "to get over Frederick, thinking of him latterly only with the gentle\n",
      "melancholy with which one thinks of some one once loved but long since\n",
      "dead; and now this place, idleness in this soft place, had thrown her\n",
      "back to the wretched state she had climbed so carefully out of years\n",
      "ago. Why, if Frederick did come she would only bore him. Hadn’t she\n",
      "seen in a flash quite soon after getting to San Salvatore that that was\n",
      "really what kept him away from her? And why should she suppose that\n",
      "now, after such a long estrangement, she would be able not to bore him,\n",
      "be able to do anything but stand before him like a tongue-tied idiot,\n",
      "with all the fingers of her spirit turned into thumbs? Besides, what a\n",
      "hopeless position, to have as it were to beseech: Please wait a\n",
      "little—please don’t be impatient—I think perhaps I shan’t be a bore\n",
      "presently.\n",

      "beneficent sun of San Salvatore, but Rose did want to be alone. Still,\n",
      "she was grateful to him for proving to her that though she might bore\n",
      "Frederick she did not bore everybody; if she had, he would not have sat\n",
      "talking to her on each occasion till it was time to go in. True he\n",
      "bored her, but that wasn’t anything like so dreadful as if she bored\n",
      "him. Then indeed her vanity would have been sadly ruffled. For now that\n",
      "Rose was not able to say her prayers she was being assailed by every\n",
      "sort of weakness: vanity, sensitiveness, irritability,\n",
      "pugnacity—strange, unfamiliar devils to have coming crowding on one and\n",
      "taking possession of one’s swept and empty heart. She had never been\n",
      "vain or irritable or pugnacious in her life before. Could it be that\n",
      "San Salvatore was capable of opposite effects, and the same sun that\n",
      "ripened Mr. Wilkins made her go acid?\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, so as to be sure of being alone, she went down, while\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins was still lingering pleasantly with Mrs. Fisher over\n",
      "breakfast, to the rocks by the water’s edge where she and Lotty had sat\n",
      "the first day. Frederick by now had got her letter. To-day, if he were\n",

      "lurked even, it seemed, in notepaper. Lotty had not dreamed of getting\n",
      "a telegram, and when she came in at lunch-time there it was. It would\n",

      "Rose clasped her hands tight round her knees. How passionately she\n",

      "not important as an asset in an organisation, but privately important,\n",
      "just to one other person, quite privately, nobody else to know or\n",
      "notice. It didn’t seem much to ask in a world so crowded with people,\n",
      "just to have one of them, only one out of all the millions, to oneself.\n",
      "Somebody who needed one, who thought of one, who was eager to come to\n",

      "arrive\n",
      "\n",
      "That day Scrap, egged on by Lotty’s persuasions and also thinking that\n",
      "perhaps she had sat long enough, had arisen from her chair and cushions\n",

      "Mr. Wilkins, who wished to go with them, stayed on Lady Caroline’s\n",
      "advice with Mrs. Fisher in order to cheer her solitude, and though he\n",
      "left off cheering her about eleven to go and look for Mrs. Arbuthnot,\n",
      "so as for a space to cheer her too, thus dividing himself impartially\n",
      "between these solitary ladies, he came back again presently mopping his\n",
      "forehead and continued with Mrs. Fisher where he had left off, for this\n",

      "difficult. She liked him, he was sure, and she was in a fair way, he\n",
      "felt, to become a client, but he feared she would be a headstrong and\n",
      "secretive client. She was certainly secretive, for though he had been\n",

      "inkling of what was so evidently worrying her.\n",
      "\n",

      "Just before half-past twelve Rose came slowly up through the pergola\n",
      "and between the camellias ranged on either side of the old stone steps.\n",
      "The rivulets of periwinkles that flowed down them when first she\n",
      "arrived were gone, and now there were these bushes, incredibly\n",
      "rosetted. Pink, white, red, striped—she fingered and smelt them one\n",
      "after the other, so as not to get to her disappointment too quickly. As\n",
      "long as she hadn’t seen for herself, seen the table in the hall quite\n",
      "empty except for its bowl of flowers, she still could hope, she still\n",
      "could have the joy of imagining the telegram lying on it waiting for\n",
      "her. But there is no smell in a camellia, as Mr. Wilkins, who was\n",
      "standing in the doorway on the look-out for her and knew what was\n",
      "necessary in horticulture, reminded her.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course. She knew it. She had been sure of it all the time. Bright\n",
      "and burning, Youth in that instant flashed down again on Rose. She flew\n",
      "up the steps, red as the camellia she had just been fingering, and was\n",
      "in the hall and tearing open the telegram before Mr. Wilkins had\n",
      "finished his sentence. Why, but if things could happen like this—why,\n",
      "but there was no end to—why, she and Frederick—they were going to\n",
      "be—again—at last—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No bad news, I trust?” said Mr. Wilkins who had followed her, for when\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh no. On the contrary—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She managed to smile. “I’m going to have a visitor,” she said, holding\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins read the telegram. It had been sent that morning from\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Thomas Briggs was at that very moment coming. He was jogging along the\n",
      "road between Mezzago and Castagneto in a fly, sincerely hoping that the\n",
      "dark-eyed lady would grasp that all he wanted was to see her, and not\n",
      "at all to see if his house were still there. He felt that an owner of\n",
      "delicacy did not intrude on a tenant. But—he had been thinking so much\n",
      "of her since that day. Rose Arbuthnot. Such a pretty name. And such a\n",
      "pretty creature—mild, milky, mothery in the best sense; the best sense\n",
      "being that she wasn’t his mother and couldn’t have been if she had\n",
      "tried, for parents were the only things impossible to have younger than\n",
      "oneself. Also, he was passing so near. It seemed absurd not just to\n",
      "look in and see if she were comfortable. He longed to see her in his\n",
      "house. He longed to see it as her background, to see her sitting in his\n",
      "chairs, drinking out of his cups, using all his things. Did she put the\n",
      "big crimson brocade cushion in the drawing-room behind her little dark\n",
      "head? Her hair and the whiteness of her skin would look lovely against\n",
      "it. Had she seen the portrait of herself on the stairs? He wondered if\n",
      "she liked it. He would explain it to her. If she didn’t paint, and she\n",
      "had said nothing to suggest it, she wouldn’t perhaps notice how exactly\n",
      "the moulding of the eyebrows and the slight hollow of the cheek—\n",
      "\n",
      "He told the fly to wait in Castagneto, and crossed the piazza, hailed\n",
      "by children and dogs, who all knew him and sprang up suddenly from\n",
      "nowhere, and walking quickly up the zigzag path, for he was an active\n",
      "young man not much more than thirty, he pulled the ancient chain that\n",
      "rang the bell, and waited decorously on the proper side of the open\n",
      "door to be allowed to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of him Francesca flung up every bit of her that would\n",
      "fling up—eyebrows, eyelids, and hands, and volubly assured him that all\n",
      "was in perfect order and that she was doing her duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, of course,” said Briggs, cutting her short. “No one doubts\n",

      "“Which mistress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are four,” said Francesca, scenting an irregularity on the part\n",
      "of the tenants, for her master looked surprised; and she felt pleased,\n",
      "for life was dull and irregularities helped it along at least a little.\n",
      "\n",

      "stood examining the picture on the staircase of that Madonna by an\n",
      "early Italian painter, name unknown, picked up by him at Orvieto, who\n",
      "was so much like his tenant. It really was remarkable, the likeness. Of\n",
      "course his tenant that day in London had had her hat on, but he was\n",
      "pretty sure her hair grew just like that off her forehead. The\n",
      "expression of the eyes, grave and sweet, was exactly the same. He\n",
      "rejoiced to think that he would always have her portrait.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up at the sound of footsteps, and there she was, coming down\n",
      "the stairs just as he had imagined her in that place, dressed in white.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was astonished to see him so soon. She had supposed he would come\n",
      "about tea-time, and till then she had meant to sit somewhere out of\n",
      "doors where she could be by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched her coming down the stairs with the utmost eager interest.\n",
      "In a moment she would be level with her portrait.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It really is extraordinary,” said Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do,” said Rose, intent only on a decent show of welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not welcome him. He was here, she felt, the telegram bitter in\n",
      "her heart, instead of Frederick, doing what she had longed Frederick\n",
      "would do, taking his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just stand still a moment—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She obeyed automatically.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rose, surprised, took it off obediently.\n",

      "“Yes—I thought so—I just wanted to make sure. And look—have you\n",
      "noticed—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to make odd swift passes with his hand over the face in the\n",
      "picture, measuring it, looking from it to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose’s surprise became amusement, and she could not help smiling. “Have\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Italian he was glib, to go back to the Signora in the top garden and\n",
      "tell her he had encountered his old friend the Signora Arbuthnot, and\n",
      "was going for a walk with her and would present himself to her later.\n",

      "been the company and conversation of Mr. Briggs. He did help her to\n",
      "recover, and the same process took place as that which Lotty had\n",

      "Since even the most religious, sober women like to know they have made\n",

      "Smiling, she was more attractive than ever. Colour came into her\n",
      "cheeks, and brightness into her eyes. She heard herself saying things\n",
      "that really sounded quite interesting and even amusing. If Frederick\n",
      "were listening now, she thought, perhaps he would see that she couldn’t\n",
      "after all be such a hopeless bore; for here was a man, nice-looking,\n",
      "young, and surely clever—he seemed clever, and she hoped he was, for\n",

      "And indeed Mr. Briggs seemed very much interested. He wanted to hear\n",

      "what she liked best, which room she had, if she were comfortable, if\n",
      "Francesca was behaving, if Domenico took care of her, and whether she\n",
      "didn’t enjoy using the yellow sitting-room—the one that got all the sun\n",
      "and looked out towards Genoa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose was ashamed how little she had noticed in the house, and how few\n",
      "of the things he spoke of as curious or beautiful in it she had even\n",
      "seen. Swamped in thoughts of Frederick, she appeared to have lived in\n",
      "San Salvatore blindly, and more than half the time had gone, and what\n",
      "had been the good of it? She might just as well have been sitting\n",
      "hankering on Hampstead Heath. No, she mightn’t; through all her\n",

      "it, that had first started her off hankering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Briggs, however, was too much alive for her to be able to spare any\n",
      "attention at this moment for Frederick, and she praised the servants in\n",
      "answer to his questions, and praised the yellow sitting-room without\n",
      "telling him she had only been in it once and then was ignominiously\n",
      "ejected, and she told him she knew hardly anything about art and\n",
      "curiosities, but thought perhaps if somebody would tell her about them\n",
      "she would know more, and she said she had spent every day since her\n",
      "arrival out-of-doors, because out-of-doors there was so very wonderful\n",

      "\n",
      "Briggs walked by her side along his paths that were yet so happily for\n",
      "the moment her paths, and felt all the innocent glows of family life.\n",
      "He was an orphan and an only child, and had a warm, domestic\n",
      "disposition. He would have adored a sister and spoilt a mother, and was\n",
      "beginning at this time to think of marrying; for though he had been\n",
      "very happy with his various loves, each of whom, contrary to the usual\n",
      "experience, turned ultimately into his devoted friend, he was fond of\n",
      "children and thought he had perhaps now got to the age of settling if\n",
      "he did not wish to be too old by the time his eldest son was twenty.\n",
      "San Salvatore had latterly seemed a little forlorn. He fancied it\n",
      "echoed when he walked about it. He had felt lonely there; so lonely\n",
      "that he had preferred this year to miss out a spring and let it. It\n",
      "wanted a wife in it. It wanted that final touch of warmth and beauty,\n",
      "for he never thought of his wife except in terms of warmth and\n",
      "beauty—she would of course be beautiful and kind. It amused him how\n",
      "much in love with this vague wife he was already.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such a rate was he making friends with the lady with the sweet name\n",
      "as he walked along the path towards the lighthouse, that he was sure\n",
      "presently he would be telling her everything about himself and his past\n",
      "doings and his future hopes; and the thought of such a swiftly\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why are you laughing?” she asked, looking at him and smiling.\n",
      "\n",

      "don’t know what I mean, except that I’m sorry.”\n",

      "He laughed again. “Oh I’m used to it. I haven’t anybody. No sisters or\n",
      "brothers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you’re an only child,” she observed intelligently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. And there’s something about you that’s exactly my idea of a—of a\n",

      "\n",
      "She was amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So—cosy,” he said, looking at her and searching for a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You wouldn’t think so if you saw my house in Hampstead,” she said, a\n",
      "vision of that austere and hard-seated dwelling presenting itself to\n",
      "her mind, with nothing soft in it except the shunned and neglected Du\n",
      "Barri sofa. No wonder, she thought, for a moment clear-brained, that\n",
      "Frederick avoided it. There was nothing cosy about his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe any place you lived in could be anything but exactly\n",
      "like you,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re not going to pretend San Salvatore is like me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I do pretend it. Surely you admit that it is beautiful?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said several things like that. She enjoyed her walk. She could not\n",
      "recollect any walk so pleasant since her courting days.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came back to tea, bringing Mr. Briggs, and looking quite different,\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins noticed, from what she had looked till then. Trouble here,\n",
      "trouble here, thought Mr. Wilkins, mentally rubbing his professional\n",
      "hands. He could see himself being called in presently to advise. On the\n",
      "one hand there was Arbuthnot, on the other hand here was Briggs.\n",
      "Trouble brewing, trouble sooner or later. But why had Briggs’s telegram\n",
      "acted on the lady like a blow? If she had turned pale from excess of\n",
      "joy, then trouble was nearer than he had supposed. She was not pale\n",
      "now; she was more like her name than he had yet seen her. Well, he was\n",
      "the man for trouble. He regretted, of course, that people should get\n",
      "into it, but being in he was their man.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Wilkins, invigorated by these thoughts, his career being very\n",
      "precious to him, proceeded to assist in doing the honours to Mr.\n",
      "Briggs, both in his quality of sharer in the temporary ownership of San\n",
      "Salvatore and of probable helper out of difficulties, with great\n",
      "hospitality, and pointed out the various features of the place to him,\n",
      "and led him to the parapet and showed him Mezzago across the bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher too was gracious. This was this young man’s house. He was a\n",
      "man of property. She liked property, and she liked men of property.\n",
      "Also there seemed a peculiar merit in being a man of property so young.\n",
      "Inheritance, of course; and inheritance was more respectable than\n",
      "acquisition. It did indicate fathers; and in an age where most people\n",
      "appeared neither to have them nor to want them she liked this too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly it was a pleasant meal, with everybody amiable and pleased.\n",
      "Briggs thought Mrs. Fisher a dear old lady, and showed he thought so;\n",
      "and again the magic worked, and she became a dear old lady. She\n",
      "developed benignity with him, and a kind of benignity which was almost\n",
      "playful—actually before tea was over including in some observation she\n",
      "made him the words “My dear boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange words in Mrs. Fisher’s mouth. It is doubtful whether in her\n",
      "life she had used them before. Rose was astonished. How nice people\n",
      "really were. When would she leave off making mistakes about them? She\n",
      "hadn’t suspected this side of Mrs. Fisher, and she began to wonder\n",
      "whether those other sides of her with which alone she was acquainted\n",
      "had not perhaps after all been the effect of her own militant and\n",
      "irritating behaviour. Probably they were. How horrid, then, she must\n",
      "have been. She felt very penitent when she saw Mrs. Fisher beneath her\n",
      "eyes blossoming out into real amiability the moment some one came along\n",
      "who was charming to her, and she could have sunk into the ground with\n",
      "shame when Mrs. Fisher presently laughed, and she realised by the shock\n",
      "it gave her that the sound was entirely new. Not once before had she or\n",
      "any one else there heard Mrs. Fisher laugh. What an indictment of the\n",
      "lot of them! For they had all laughed, the others, some more and some\n",
      "less, at one time or another since their arrival, and only Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "had not. Clearly, since she could enjoy herself as she was now enjoying\n",
      "herself, she had not enjoyed herself before. Nobody had cared whether\n",
      "she did or not, except perhaps Lotty. Yes; Lotty had cared, and had\n",
      "wanted her to be happy; but Lotty seemed to produce a bad effect on\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, while as for Rose herself she had never been with her for\n",
      "five minutes without wanting, really wanting, to provoke and oppose\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "How very horrid she had been. She had behaved unpardonably. Her\n",
      "penitence showed itself in a shy and deferential solicitude towards\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher which made the observant Briggs think her still more\n",
      "angelic, and wish for a moment that he were an old lady himself in\n",
      "order to be behaved to by Rose Arbuthnot just like that. There was\n",
      "evidently no end, he thought, to the things she could do sweetly. He\n",
      "would even not mind taking medicine, really nasty medicine, if it were\n",
      "Rose Arbuthnot bending over him with the dose.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt his bright blue eyes, the brighter because he was so sunburnt,\n",
      "fixed on her with a twinkle in them, and smiling asked him what he was\n",
      "thinking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he couldn’t very well tell her that, he said; and added, “Some\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trouble, trouble,” thought Mr. Wilkins at this, again mentally rubbing\n",
      "his hands. “Well, I’m their man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Fisher benignly, “you have no thoughts we may not\n",
      "hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure,” said Briggs, “I would be telling you every one of my\n",
      "secrets in a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would be telling somebody very safe, then,” said Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "benevolently—just such a son would she have liked to have had. “And in\n",
      "return,” she went on, “I daresay I would tell you mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah no,” said Mr. Wilkins, adapting himself to this tone of easy\n",
      "badinage, “I must protest. I really must. I have a prior claim, I am\n",
      "the older friend. I have known Mrs. Fisher ten days, and you, Briggs,\n",
      "have not yet known her one. I assert my right to be told her secrets\n",
      "first. That is,” he added, bowing gallantly, “if she has any—which I\n",
      "beg leave to doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, haven’t I!” exclaimed Mrs. Fisher, thinking of those green leaves.\n",
      "That she should exclaim at all was surprising, but that she should do\n",
      "it with gaiety was miraculous. Rose could only watch her in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I shall worm them out,” said Briggs with equal gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They won’t need much worming out,” said Mrs. Fisher. “My difficulty is\n",
      "to keep them from bursting out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It might have been Lotty talking. Mr. Wilkins adjusted the single\n",
      "eyeglass he carried with him for occasions like this, and examined Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher carefully. Rose looked on, unable not to smile too since Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher seemed so much amused, though Rose did not quite know why, and\n",
      "her smile was a little uncertain, for Mrs. Fisher amused was a new\n",
      "sight, not without its awe-inspiring aspects, and had to be got\n",
      "accustomed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Mrs. Fisher was thinking was how much surprised they would be if\n",
      "she told them of her very odd and exciting sensation of going to come\n",
      "out all over buds. They would think she was an extremely silly old\n",
      "woman, and so would she have thought as lately as two days ago; but the\n",
      "bud idea was becoming familiar to her, she was more apprivoisée now,\n",
      "as dear Matthew Arnold used to say, and though it would undoubtedly be\n",
      "best if one’s appearance and sensations matched, yet supposing they did\n",
      "not—and one couldn’t have everything—was it not better to feel young\n",
      "somewhere rather than old everywhere? Time enough to be old everywhere\n",
      "again, inside as well as out, when she got back to her sarcophagus in\n",
      "Prince of Wales Terrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it is probable that without the arrival of Briggs Mrs. Fisher would\n",
      "have gone on secretly fermenting in her shell. The others only knew her\n",
      "as severe. It would have been more than her dignity could bear suddenly\n",
      "to relax—especially towards the three young women. But now came the\n",
      "stranger Briggs, a stranger who at once took to her as no young man had\n",
      "taken to her in her life, and it was the coming of Briggs and his real\n",
      "and manifest appreciation—for just such a grandmother, thought Briggs,\n",
      "hungry for home life and its concomitants, would he have liked to\n",
      "have—that released Mrs. Fisher from her shell; and here she was at\n",
      "last, as Lotty had predicted, pleased, good-humoured and benevolent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty, coming back half an hour later from her picnic, and following\n",
      "the sound of voices into the top garden in the hope of still finding\n",
      "tea, saw at once what had happened, for Mrs. Fisher at that very moment\n",
      "was laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s burst her cocoon,” thought Lotty; and swift as she was in all\n",
      "her movements, and impulsive, and also without any sense of propriety\n",
      "to worry and delay her, she bent over the back of Mrs. Fisher’s chair\n",
      "and kissed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Fisher, starting violently, for such a\n",
      "thing had not happened to her since Mr. Fisher’s earlier days, and then\n",
      "only gingerly. This kiss was a real kiss, and rested on Mrs. Fisher’s\n",
      "cheek a moment with a strange, soft sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she saw whose it was, a deep flush spread over her face. Mrs.\n",
      "Wilkins kissing her and the kiss feeling so affectionate Even if\n",
      "she had wanted to she could not in the presence of the appreciative Mr.\n",
      "Briggs resume her cast-off severity and begin rebuking again; but she\n",
      "did not want to. Was it possible Mrs. Wilkins liked her—had liked her\n",
      "all this time, while she had been so much disliking her herself? A\n",
      "queer little trickle of warmth filtered through the frozen defences of\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher’s heart. Somebody young kissing her—somebody young\n",
      "wanting to kiss her Very much flushed, she watched the strange\n",
      "creature, apparently quite unconscious she had done anything\n",
      "extraordinary, shaking hands with Mr. Briggs, on her husband’s\n",
      "introducing him, and immediately embarking on the friendliest\n",
      "conversation with him, exactly as if she had known him all her life.\n",
      "What a strange creature; what a very strange creature. It was natural,\n",
      "she being so strange, that one should have, perhaps, misjudged her\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure you want some tea,” said Briggs with eager hospitality to\n",
      "Lotty. He thought her delightful,—freckles, picnic-untidiness and all.\n",
      "Just such a sister would he—\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is cold,” he said, feeling the teapot. “I’ll tell Francesca to\n",
      "make you some fresh—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off and blushed. “Aren’t I forgetting myself,” he said,\n",
      "laughing and looking round at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll go and tell Francesca,” said Rose, getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” said Briggs. “Don’t go away.” And he put his hands to his\n",
      "mouth and shouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Francesca!” shouted Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came running. No summons in their experience had been answered by\n",
      "her with such celerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Her Master’s voice,’” remarked Mr. Wilkins; aptly, he considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make fresh tea,” ordered Briggs in Italian. “Quick—quick—” And then\n",
      "remembering himself he blushed again, and begged everybody’s pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs then explained to Lotty what he had explained twice already,\n",
      "once to Rose and once to the other two, that he was on his way to Rome\n",
      "and thought he would get out at Mezzago and just look in to see if they\n",
      "were comfortable and continue his journey the next day, staying the\n",
      "night in an hotel at Mezzago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how ridiculous,” said Lotty. “Of course you must stay here. It’s\n",
      "your house. There’s Kate Lumley’s room,” she added, turning to Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher. “You wouldn’t mind Mr. Briggs having it for one night? Kate\n",
      "Lumley isn’t in it, you know,” she said turning to Briggs again and\n",
      "laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mrs. Fisher to her immense surprise laughed too. She knew that\n",
      "at any other time this remark would have struck her as excessively\n",
      "unseemly, and yet now she only thought it funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "No indeed, she assured Briggs, Kate Lumley was not in that room. Very\n",
      "fortunately, for she was an excessively wide person and the room was\n",
      "excessively narrow. Kate Lumley might get into it, but that was about\n",
      "all. Once in, she would fit it so tightly that probably she would never\n",
      "be able to get out again. It was entirely at Mr. Briggs’s disposal, and\n",
      "she hoped he would do nothing so absurd as go to an hotel—he, the owner\n",
      "of the whole place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose listened to this speech wide-eyed with amazement. Mrs. Fisher\n",
      "laughed very much as she made it. Lotty laughed very much too, and at\n",
      "the end of it bent down and kissed her again—kissed her several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you see, my dear boy,” said Mrs. Fisher, “you must stay here and\n",
      "give us all a great deal of pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A great deal indeed,” corroborated Mr. Wilkins heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very great deal,” repeated Mrs. Fisher, looking exactly like a\n",
      "pleased mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do,” said Rose, on Briggs’s turning inquiringly to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How kind of you all,” he said, his face broad with smiles. “I’d love\n",
      "to be a guest here. What a new sensation. And with three such—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off and looked round. “I say,” he asked, “oughtn’t I to have a\n",
      "fourth hostess? Francesca said she had four mistresses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. There’s Lady Caroline,” said Lotty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then hadn’t we better find out first if she invites me too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but she’s sure—” began Lotty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The daughter of the Droitwiches, Briggs,” said Mr. Wilkins, “is not\n",
      "likely to be wanting in the proper hospitable impulses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The daughter of the—” repeated Briggs; but he stopped dead, for there\n",
      "in the doorway was the daughter of the Droitwiches herself; or rather,\n",
      "coming towards him out of the dark doorway into the brightness of the\n",
      "sunset, was that which he had not in his life yet seen but only dreamed\n",
      "of, his ideal of absolute loveliness.\n",

      "And then when she spoke  what chance was there for poor Briggs? He\n",
      "was undone. All Scrap said was, “How do you do,” on Mr. Wilkins\n",
      "presenting him, but it was enough; it undid Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a cheerful, chatty, happy young man, overflowing with life and\n",
      "friendliness, he became silent, solemn, and with little beads on his\n",
      "temples. Also he became clumsy, dropping the teaspoon as he handed her\n",
      "her cup, mismanaging the macaroons, so that one rolled on the ground.\n",
      "His eyes could not keep off the enchanting face for a moment; and when\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins, elucidating him, for he failed to elucidate himself,\n",
      "informed Lady Caroline that in Mr. Briggs she beheld the owner of San\n",
      "Salvatore, who was on his way to Rome, but had got out at Mezzago, etc.\n",
      "etc., and that the other three ladies had invited him to spend the\n",
      "night in what was to all intents and purposes his own house rather than\n",
      "an hotel, and Mr. Briggs was only waiting for the seal of her approval\n",
      "to this invitation, she being the fourth hostess—when Mr. Wilkins,\n",
      "balancing his sentences and being admirably clear and enjoying the\n",
      "sound of his own cultured voice, explained the position in this manner\n",
      "to Lady Caroline, Briggs sat and said never a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "A deep melancholy invaded Scrap. The symptoms of the incipient grabber\n",
      "were all there and only too familiar, and she knew that if Briggs\n",
      "stayed her rest-cure might be regarded as over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Kate Lumley occurred to her. She caught at Kate as at a straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would have been delightful,” she said, faintly smiling at\n",
      "Briggs—she could not in decency not smile, at least a little, but even\n",
      "a little betrayed the dimple, and Briggs’s eyes became more fixed than\n",
      "ever—“I’m only wondering if there is room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, there is,” said Lotty. “There’s Kate Lumley’s room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought,” said Scrap to Mrs. Fisher, and it seemed to Briggs that he\n",
      "had never heard music till now, “your friend was expected immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Fisher—with an odd placidness, Scrap thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Lumley,” said Mr. Wilkins, “—or should I,” he inquired of Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher, “say Mrs.?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody has ever married Kate,” said Mrs. Fisher complacently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. Miss Lumley does not arrive to-day in any case, Lady\n",
      "Caroline, and Mr. Briggs has—unfortunately, if I may say so—to continue\n",
      "his journey to-morrow, so that his staying would in no way interfere\n",
      "with Miss Lumley’s possible movements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then of course I join in the invitation,” said Scrap, with what was to\n",
      "Briggs the most divine cordiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stammered something, flushing scarlet, and Scrap thought, “Oh,” and\n",
      "turned her head away; but that merely made Briggs acquainted with her\n",
      "profile, and if there existed anything more lovely than Scrap’s full\n",
      "face it was her profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was only for this one afternoon and evening. He would leave,\n",
      "no doubt, the first thing in the morning. It took hours to get to Rome.\n",
      "Awful if he hung on till the night train. She had a feeling that the\n",
      "principal express to Rome passed through at night. Why hadn’t that\n",
      "woman Kate Lumley arrived yet? She had forgotten all about her, but now\n",
      "she remembered she was to have been invited a fortnight ago. What had\n",
      "become of her? This man, once let in, would come and see her in London,\n",
      "would haunt the places she was likely to go to. He had the makings, her\n",
      "experienced eye could see, of a passionately persistent grabber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If,” thought Mr. Wilkins, observing Briggs’s face and sudden silence,\n",
      "“any understanding existed between this young fellow and Mrs.\n",
      "Arbuthnot, there is now going to be trouble. Trouble of a different\n",
      "nature from the kind I feared, in which Arbuthnot would have played a\n",
      "leading part, in fact the part of petitioner, but trouble that may need\n",
      "help and advice none the less for its not being publicly scandalous.\n",
      "Briggs, impelled by his passions and her beauty, will aspire to the\n",
      "daughter of the Droitwiches. She, naturally and properly, will repel\n",
      "him. Mrs. Arbuthnot, left in the cold, will be upset and show it.\n",
      "Arbuthnot on his arrival will find his wife in enigmatic tears.\n",
      "Inquiring into their cause, he will be met with an icy reserve. More\n",
      "trouble may then be expected, and in me they will seek and find their\n",
      "adviser. When Lotty said Mrs. Arbuthnot wanted her husband, she was\n",
      "wrong. What Mrs. Arbuthnot wants is Briggs, and it looks uncommonly as\n",
      "if she were not going to get him. Well, I’m their man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are your things, Mr. Briggs?” asked Mrs. Fisher, her voice round\n",
      "with motherliness. “Oughtn’t they to be fetched?” For the sun was\n",
      "nearly in the sea now, and the sweet-smelling April dampness that\n",
      "followed immediately on its disappearance was beginning to steal into\n",
      "the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs started. “My things?” he repeated. “Oh yes—I must fetch them.\n",
      "They’re in Mezzago. I’ll send Domenico. My fly is waiting in the\n",
      "village. He can go back in it. I’ll go and tell him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up. To whom was he talking? To Mrs. Fisher, ostensibly, yet his\n",
      "eyes were fixed on Scrap, who said nothing and looked at no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, recollecting himself, he stammered, “I’m awfully sorry—I keep on\n",
      "forgetting—I’ll go down and fetch them myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can easily send Domenico,” said Rose; and at her gentle voice he\n",
      "turned his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, there was his friend, the sweet-named lady—but how had she not in\n",
      "this short interval changed! Was it the failing light making her so\n",
      "colourless, so vague-featured, so dim, so much like a ghost? A nice\n",
      "good ghost, of course, and still with a pretty name, but only a ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned from her to Scrap again, and forgot Rose Arbuthnot’s\n",
      "existence. How was it possible for him to bother about anybody or\n",
      "anything else in this first moment of being face to face with his dream\n",
      "come true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs had not supposed or hoped that any one as beautiful as his dream\n",
      "of beauty existed. He had never till now met even an approximation.\n",
      "Pretty women, charming women by the score he had met and properly\n",
      "appreciated, but never the real, the godlike thing itself. He used to\n",
      "think, “If ever I saw a perfectly beautiful woman I should die”; and\n",
      "though, having now met what to his ideas was a perfectly beautiful\n",
      "woman, he did not die, he became very nearly as incapable of managing\n",
      "his own affairs as if he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others were obliged to arrange everything for him. By questions\n",
      "they extracted from him that his luggage was in the station cloakroom\n",
      "at Mezzago, and they sent for Domenico, and, urged and prompted by\n",
      "everybody except Scrap, who sat in silence and looked at no one, Briggs\n",
      "was induced to give him the necessary instructions for going back in\n",
      "the fly and bringing out his things.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sad sight to see the collapse of Briggs. Everybody noticed it,\n",
      "even Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “the way one pretty face can turn\n",
      "a delightful man into an idiot is past all patience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And feeling the air getting chilly, and the sight of the enthralled\n",
      "Briggs painful, she went in to order his room to be got ready,\n",
      "regretting now that she had pressed the poor boy to stay. She had\n",
      "forgotten Lady Caroline’s kill-joy face for the moment, and the more\n",
      "completely owing to the absence of any ill effects produced by it on\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins. Poor boy. Such a charming boy too, left to himself. It was\n",
      "true she could not accuse Lady Caroline of not leaving him to himself,\n",
      "for she was taking no notice of him at all, but that did not help.\n",
      "Exactly like foolish moths did men, in other respects intelligent,\n",
      "flutter round the impassive lighted candle of a pretty face. She had\n",
      "seen them doing it. She had looked on only too often. Almost she laid a\n",
      "motherly hand on Briggs’s fair head as she passed him. Poor boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Scrap, having finished her cigarette, got up and went indoors too.\n",
      "She saw no reason why she should sit there in order to gratify Mr.\n",
      "Briggs’s desire to stare. She would have liked to stay out longer, to\n",
      "go to her corner behind the daphne bushes and look at the sunset sky\n",
      "and watch the lights coming out one by one in the village below and\n",
      "smell the sweet moistness of the evening, but if she did Mr. Briggs\n",
      "would certainly follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old familiar tyranny had begun again. Her holiday of peace and\n",
      "liberation was interrupted—perhaps over, for who knew if he would go\n",
      "away, after all, to-morrow? He might leave the house, driven out of it\n",
      "by Kate Lumley, but there was nothing to prevent his taking rooms in\n",
      "the village and coming up every day. This tyranny of one person over\n",
      "another! And she was so miserably constructed that she wouldn’t even be\n",
      "able to frown him down without being misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap, who loved this time of the evening in her corner, felt indignant\n",
      "with Mr. Briggs who was doing her out of it, and she turned her back on\n",
      "the garden and him and went towards the house without a look or a word.\n",
      "But Briggs, when he realised her intention, leapt to his feet, snatched\n",
      "chairs which were not in her way out of it, kicked a footstool which\n",
      "was not in her path on one side, hurried to the door, which stood wide\n",
      "open, in order to hold it open, and followed her through it, walking by\n",
      "her side along the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? Well, it was his hall; she\n",
      "couldn’t prevent his walking along it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” he said, not able while walking to take his eyes off her, so\n",
      "that he knocked against several things he would otherwise have\n",
      "avoided—the corner of a bookcase, an ancient carved cupboard, the table\n",
      "with the flowers on it, shaking the water over—“that you are quite\n",
      "comfortable here? If you’re not I’ll—I’ll flay them alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice vibrated. What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? She could of\n",
      "course stay in her room the whole time, say she was ill, not appear at\n",
      "dinner; but again, the tyranny of this \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very comfortable indeed,” said Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I had dreamed you were coming—” he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a wonderful old place,” said Scrap, doing her utmost to sound\n",
      "detached and forbidding, but with little hope of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kitchen was on this floor, and passing its door, which was open a\n",
      "crack, they were observed by the servants, whose thoughts, communicated\n",
      "to each other by looks, may be roughly reproduced by such rude symbols\n",
      "as Aha and Oho—symbols which represented and included their\n",
      "appreciation of the inevitable, their foreknowledge of the inevitable,\n",
      "and their complete understanding and approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going upstairs?” asked Briggs, as she paused at the foot of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which room do you sit in? The drawing-room, or the small yellow room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my own room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So then he couldn’t go up with her; so then all he could do was to wait\n",
      "till she came out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He longed to ask her which was her own room—it thrilled him to hear her\n",
      "call any room in his house her own room—that he might picture her in\n",
      "it. He longed to know if by any happy chance it was his room, for ever\n",
      "after to be filled with her wonder; but he didn’t dare. He would find\n",
      "that out later from some one else—Francesca, anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I shan’t see you again till dinner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dinner is at eight,” was Scrap’s evasive answer as she went upstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched her go.\n",
      "\n",
      "She passed the Madonna, the portrait of Rose Arbuthnot, and the\n",
      "dark-eyed figure he had thought so sweet seemed to turn pale, to\n",
      "shrivel into insignificance as she passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned the bend of the stairs, and the setting sun, shining through\n",
      "the west window a moment on her face, turned her to glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "She disappeared, and the sun went out too, and the stairs were dark and\n",
      "empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened till her footsteps were silent, trying to tell from the\n",
      "sound of the shutting door which room she had gone into, then wandered\n",
      "aimlessly away through the hall again, and found himself back in the\n",
      "top garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap from her window saw him there. She saw Lotty and Rose sitting on\n",
      "the end parapet, where she would have liked to have been, and she saw\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins buttonholing Briggs and evidently telling him the story of\n",
      "the oleander tree in the middle of the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs was listening with a patience she thought rather nice, seeing\n",
      "that it was his oleander and his own father’s story. She knew Mr.\n",
      "Wilkins was telling him the story by his gestures. Domenico had told it\n",
      "her soon after her arrival, and he had also told Mrs. Fisher, who had\n",
      "told Mr. Wilkins. Mrs. Fisher thought highly of this story, and often\n",
      "spoke of it. It was about a cherrywood walking-stick. Briggs’s father\n",
      "had thrust this stick into the ground at that spot, and said to\n",
      "Domenico’s father, who was then the gardener, “Here we will have an\n",
      "oleander.” And Briggs’s father left the stick in the ground as a\n",
      "reminder to Domenico’s father, and presently—how long afterwards nobody\n",
      "remembered—the stick began to sprout, and it was an oleander.\n",
      "\n",
      "There stood poor Mr. Briggs being told all about it, and listening to\n",
      "the story he must have known from infancy with patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably he was thinking of something else. She was afraid he was. How\n",
      "unfortunate, how extremely unfortunate, the determination that seized\n",
      "people to get hold of and engulf other people. If only they could be\n",
      "induced to stand more on their own feet. Why couldn’t Mr. Briggs be\n",
      "more like Lotty, who never wanted anything of anybody, but was complete\n",
      "in herself and respected other people’s completeness? One loved being\n",
      "with Lotty. With her one was free, and yet befriended. Mr. Briggs\n",
      "looked so really nice, too. She thought she might like him if only he\n",
      "wouldn’t so excessively like her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap felt melancholy. Here she was shut up in her bedroom, which was\n",
      "stuffy from the afternoon sun that had been pouring into it, instead of\n",
      "out in the cool garden, and all because of Mr. Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intolerable tyranny, she thought, flaring up. She wouldn’t endure it;\n",
      "she would go out all the same; she would run downstairs while Mr.\n",
      "Wilkins—really that man was a treasure—held Mr. Briggs down telling him\n",
      "about the oleander, and get out of the house by the front door, and\n",
      "take cover in the shadows of the zigzag path. Nobody could see her\n",
      "there; nobody would think of looking for her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She snatched up a wrap, for she did not mean to come back for a long\n",
      "while, perhaps not even to dinner—it would be all Mr. Briggs’s fault if\n",
      "she went dinnerless and hungry—and with another glance out of the\n",
      "window to see if she were still safe, she stole out and got away to the\n",
      "sheltering trees of the zigzag path, and there sat down on one of the\n",
      "seats placed at each bend to assist the upward journey of those who\n",
      "were breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, this was lovely, thought Scrap with a sigh of relief. How cool. How\n",
      "good it smelt. She could see the quiet water of the little harbour\n",
      "through the pine trunks, and the lights coming out in the houses on the\n",
      "other side, and all round her the green dusk was splashed by the\n",
      "rose-pink of the gladioluses in the grass and the white of the crowding\n",
      "daisies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, this was lovely. So still. Nothing moving—not a leaf, not a stalk.\n",
      "The only sound was a dog barking, far away somewhere up on the hills,\n",
      "or when the door of the little restaurant in the piazza below was\n",
      "opened and there was a burst of voices, silenced again immediately by\n",
      "the swinging to of the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew in a deep breath of pleasure. Ah, this was—\n",
      "\n",
      "Her deep breath was arrested in the middle. What was that?\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned forward listening, her body tense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Footsteps. On the zigzag path. Briggs. Finding her out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should she run?\n",
      "\n",
      "No—the footsteps were coming up, not down. Some one from the village.\n",
      "Perhaps Angelo, with provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "She relaxed again. But the steps were not the steps of Angelo, that\n",
      "swift and springy youth; they were slow and considered, and they kept\n",
      "on pausing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some one who isn’t used to hills,” thought Scrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of going back to the house did not occur to her. She was\n",
      "afraid of nothing in life except love. Brigands or murderers as such\n",
      "held no terrors for the daughter of the Droitwiches; she only would\n",
      "have been afraid of them if they left off being brigands and murderers\n",
      "and began instead to try and make love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment the footsteps turned the corner of her bit of path, and\n",
      "stood still.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Getting his wind,” thought Scrap, not looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then as he—from the sounds of the steps she took them to belong to a\n",
      "man—did not move, she turned her head, and beheld with astonishment a\n",
      "person she had seen a good deal of lately in London, the well-known\n",
      "writer of amusing memoirs, Mr. Ferdinand Arundel.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared. Nothing in the way of being followed surprised her any\n",
      "more, but that he should have discovered where she was surprised her.\n",
      "Her mother had promised faithfully to tell no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You?” she said, feeling betrayed. “Here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He came up to her and took off his hat. His forehead beneath the hat\n",
      "was wet with the beads of unaccustomed climbing. He looked ashamed and\n",
      "entreating, like a guilty but devoted dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must forgive me,” he said. “Lady Droitwich told me where you were,\n",
      "and as I happened to be passing through on my way to Rome I thought I\n",
      "would get out at Mezzago and just look in and see how you were.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—didn’t my mother tell you I was doing a rest-cure?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. She did. And that’s why I haven’t intruded on you earlier in the\n",
      "day. I thought you would probably sleep all day, and wake up about now\n",
      "so as to be fed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know. I’ve got nothing to say in excuse. I couldn’t help myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” thought Scrap, “comes of mother insisting on having authors to\n",
      "lunch, and me being so much more amiable in appearance than I really\n",
      "am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been amiable to Ferdinand Arundel; she liked him—or rather she\n",
      "did not dislike him. He seemed a jovial, simple man, and had the eyes\n",
      "of a nice dog. Also, though it was evident that he admired her, he had\n",
      "not in London grabbed. There he had merely been a good-natured,\n",
      "harmless person of entertaining conversation, who helped to make\n",
      "luncheons agreeable. Now it appeared that he too was a grabber. Fancy\n",
      "following her out there—daring to. Nobody else had. Perhaps her mother\n",
      "had given him the address because she considered him so absolutely\n",
      "harmless, and thought he might be useful and see her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, whatever he was he couldn’t possibly give her the trouble an\n",
      "active young man like Mr. Briggs might give her. Mr. Briggs,\n",
      "infatuated, would be reckless, she felt, would stick at nothing, would\n",
      "lose his head publicly. She could imagine Mr. Briggs doing things with\n",
      "rope-ladders, and singing all night under her window—being really\n",
      "difficult and uncomfortable. Mr. Arundel hadn’t the figure for any kind\n",
      "of recklessness. He had lived too long and too well. She was sure he\n",
      "couldn’t sing, and wouldn’t want to. He must be at least forty. How\n",
      "many good dinners could not a man have eaten by the time he was forty?\n",
      "And if during that time instead of taking exercise he had sat writing\n",
      "books, he would quite naturally acquire the figure Mr. Arundel had in\n",
      "fact acquired—the figure rather for conversation than adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap, who had become melancholy at the sight of Briggs, became\n",
      "philosophical at the sight of Arundel. Here he was. She couldn’t send\n",
      "him away till after dinner. He must be nourished.\n",
      "\n",
      "This being so, she had better make the best of it, and do that with a\n",
      "good grace which anyhow wasn’t to be avoided. Besides, he would be a\n",
      "temporary shelter from Mr. Briggs. She was at least acquainted with\n",
      "Ferdinand Arundel, and could hear news from him of her mother and her\n",
      "friends, and such talk would put up a defensive barrier at dinner\n",
      "between herself and the approaches of the other one. And it was only\n",
      "for one dinner, and he couldn’t eat her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She therefore prepared herself for friendliness. “I’m to be fed,” she\n",
      "said, ignoring his last remark, “at eight, and you must come up and be\n",
      "fed too. Sit down and get cool and tell me how everybody is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I really dine with you? In these travelling things?” he said,\n",
      "wiping his forehead before sitting down beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was too lovely to be true, he thought. Just to look at her for an\n",
      "hour, just to hear her voice, was enough reward for his journey and his\n",
      "fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course. I suppose you’ve left your fly in the village, and will be\n",
      "going on from Mezzago by the night train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or stay in Mezzago in an hotel and go on to-morrow. But tell me,” he\n",
      "said, gazing at the adorable profile, “about yourself. London has been\n",
      "extraordinarily dull and empty. Lady Droitwich said you were with\n",
      "people here she didn’t know. I hope they’ve been kind to you? You\n",
      "look—well, as if your cure had done everything a cure should.”\n",

      "\n",

      "Scrap wanted to know so much about her mother that Arundel had\n",
      "presently to invent. He would talk about anything she wished if only he\n",
      "might be with her for a while and see her and hear her, but he knew\n",
      "very little of the Droitwiches and their friends really—beyond meeting\n",
      "them at those bigger functions where literature is also represented,\n",
      "and amusing them at luncheons and dinners, he knew very little of them\n",
      "really. To them he had always remained Mr. Arundel; no one called him\n",
      "Ferdinand; and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening\n",
      "papers and the frequenters of clubs. But he was, however, good at\n",
      "inventing; and as soon as he had come to an end of first-hand\n",
      "knowledge, in order to answer her inquiries and keep her there to\n",
      "himself he proceeded to invent. It was quite easy to fasten some of the\n",
      "entertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and\n",
      "pretend they were theirs. Scrap, who had that affection for her parents\n",
      "which warms in absence, was athirst for news, and became more and more\n",
      "interested by the news he gradually imparted.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it was ordinary news. He had met her mother here, and seen her\n",
      "there. She looked very well; she said so and so. But presently the\n",
      "things Lady Droitwich had said took on an unusual quality: they became\n",
      "amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother said that?” Scrap interrupted, surprised.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Mother did that?” Scrap inquired, wide-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arundel warmed to his work. He fathered some of the most entertaining\n",
      "ideas he had lately had on to Lady Droitwich, and also any charming\n",
      "funny things that had been done—or might have been done, for he could\n",
      "imagine almost anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap’s eyes grew round with wonder and affectionate pride in her\n",
      "mother. Why, but how funny—fancy mother. What an old darling. Did she\n",
      "really do that? How perfectly adorable of her. And did she really\n",
      "say—but how wonderful of her to think of it. What sort of a face did\n",
      "Lloyd George make?\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed and laughed, and had a great longing to hug her mother, and\n",
      "the time flew, and it grew quite dusk, and it grew nearly dark, and Mr.\n",
      "Arundel still went on amusing her, and it was a quarter to eight before\n",
      "she suddenly remembered dinner.\n",

      "slowly. Fortunately he was near the top, and Francesca came down the\n",
      "pergola to pilot him indoors, and having shown him where he could wash\n",
      "she put him in the empty drawing-room to cool himself by the crackling\n",
      "wood fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got as far away from the fire as he could, and stood in one of the\n",
      "deep window-recesses looking out at the distant lights of Mezzago. The\n",
      "drawing-room door was open, and the house was quiet with the hush that\n",
      "precedes dinner, when the inhabitants are all shut up in their rooms\n",

      "her marriage, formed of two pearl lilies tied together by a blue enamel\n",
      "ribbon on which was written in gold letters Esto perpetua; Mr.\n",
      "Wilkins was sitting on the edge of his bed brushing his wife’s\n",
      "hair—thus far in this third week had he progressed in\n",
      "demonstrativeness—while she, for her part, sitting on a chair in front\n",
      "of him, put his studs in a clean shirt; and Rose, ready dressed, sat at\n",
      "her window considering her day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose was quite aware of what had happened to Mr. Briggs. If she had had\n",
      "any difficulty about it, Lotty would have removed it by the frank\n",
      "comments she made while she and Rose sat together after tea on the\n",
      "wall. Lotty was delighted at more love being introduced into San\n",
      "Salvatore, even if it were only one-sided, and said that when once\n",
      "Rose’s husband was there she didn’t suppose, now that Mrs. Fisher too\n",
      "had at last come unglued—Rose protested at the expression, and Lotty\n",
      "retorted that it was in Keats—there would be another place in the world\n",
      "more swarming with happiness than San Salvatore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband,” said Lotty, swinging her feet, “might be here quite\n",
      "soon, perhaps to-morrow evening if he starts at once, and there’ll be a\n",
      "glorious final few days before we all go home refreshed for life. I\n",
      "don’t believe any of us will ever be the same again—and I wouldn’t be a\n",
      "bit surprised if Caroline doesn’t end by getting fond of the young man\n",
      "Briggs. It’s in the air. You have to get fond of people here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose sat at her window thinking of these things. Lotty’s optimism \n",
      "yet it had been justified by Mr. Wilkins; and look, too, at Mrs.\n",
      "Fisher. If only it would come true as well about Frederick! For Rose,\n",
      "who between lunch and tea had left off thinking about Frederick, was\n",

      "\n",
      "It had been funny and delightful, that little interlude of admiration,\n",
      "but of course it couldn’t go on once Caroline appeared. Rose knew her\n",
      "place. She could see as well as any one the unusual, the unique\n",
      "loveliness of Lady Caroline. How warm, though, things like admiration\n",
      "and appreciation made one feel, how capable of really deserving them,\n",
      "how different, how glowing. They seemed to quicken unsuspected\n",
      "faculties into life. She was sure she had been a thoroughly amusing\n",
      "woman between lunch and tea, and a pretty one too. She was quite\n",
      "certain she had been pretty; she saw it in Mr. Briggs’s eyes as clearly\n",
      "as in a looking-glass. For a brief space, she thought, she had been\n",
      "like a torpid fly brought back to gay buzzing by the lighting of a fire\n",
      "in a wintry room. She still buzzed, she still tingled, just at the\n",
      "remembrance. What fun it had been, having an admirer even for that\n",
      "little while. No wonder people liked admirers. They seemed, in some\n",
      "strange way, to make one come alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it was all over she still glowed with it and felt more\n",
      "exhilarated, more optimistic, more as Lotty probably constantly felt,\n",
      "than she had done since she was a girl. She dressed with care, though\n",
      "she knew Mr. Briggs would no longer see her, but it gave her pleasure\n",
      "to see how pretty, while she was about it, she could make herself look;\n",
      "and very nearly she stuck a crimson camellia in her hair down by her\n",
      "ear. She did hold it there for a minute, and it looked almost sinfully\n",
      "attractive and was exactly the colour of her mouth, but she took it out\n",
      "again with a smile and a sigh and put it in the proper place for\n",
      "flowers, which is water. She mustn’t be silly, she thought. Think of\n",
      "the poor. Soon she would be back with them again, and what would a\n",
      "camellia behind her ear seem like then? Simply fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on one thing she was determined: the first thing she would do when\n",
      "she got home would be to have it out with Frederick. If he didn’t come\n",
      "to San Salvatore that is what she would do—the very first thing. Long\n",
      "ago she ought to have done this, but always she had been handicapped,\n",
      "when she tried to, by being so dreadfully fond of him and so much\n",
      "afraid that fresh wounds were going to be given her wretched, soft\n",
      "heart. But now let him wound her as much as he chose, as much as he\n",
      "possibly could, she would still have it out with him. Not that he ever\n",
      "intentionally wounded her; she knew he never meant to, she knew he\n",
      "often had no idea of having done it. For a person who wrote books,\n",
      "thought Rose, Frederick didn’t seem to have much imagination. Anyhow,\n",
      "she said to herself, getting up from the dressing-table, things\n",
      "couldn’t go on like this. She would have it out with him. This separate\n",
      "life, this freezing loneliness, she had had enough of it. Why shouldn’t\n",
      "she too be happy? Why on earth—the energetic expression matched her\n",
      "mood of rebelliousness—shouldn’t she too be loved and allowed to love?\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at her little clock. Still ten minutes before dinner. Tired\n",
      "of staying in her bedroom she thought she would go on to Mrs. Fisher’s\n",
      "battlements, which would be empty at this hour, and watch the moon rise\n",
      "out of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went into the deserted upper hall with this intention, but was\n",
      "attracted on her way along it by the firelight shining through the open\n",
      "door of the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "How gay it looked. The fire transformed the room. A dark, ugly room in\n",
      "the daytime, it was transformed just as she had been transformed by the\n",
      "warmth of—no, she wouldn’t be silly; she would think of the poor; the\n",
      "thought of them always brought her down to sobriety at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "She peeped in. Firelight and flowers; and outside the deep slits of\n",
      "windows hung the blue curtain of the night. How pretty. What a sweet\n",
      "place San Salvatore was. And that gorgeous lilac on the table—she must\n",
      "go and put her face in it \n",
      "\n",
      "But she never got to the lilac. She went one step towards it, and then\n",
      "stood still, for she had seen the figure looking out of the window in\n",
      "the farthest corner, and it was Frederick.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the blood in Rose’s body rushed to her heart and seemed to stop its\n",
      "beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick. Come.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood quite still. He had not heard her. He did not turn round. She\n",
      "stood looking at him. The miracle had happened, and he had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood holding her breath. So he needed her, for he had come\n",
      "instantly. So he too must have been thinking, longing \n",
      "\n",
      "Her heart, which had seemed to stop beating, was suffocating her now,\n",
      "the way it raced along. Frederick did love her then—he must love her,\n",
      "or why had he come? Something, perhaps her absence, had made him turn\n",
      "to her, want her  and now the understanding she had made up her\n",
      "mind to have with him would be quite—would be quite—easy—\n",
      "\n",
      "Her thoughts wouldn’t go on. Her mind stammered. She couldn’t think.\n",
      "She could only see and feel. She didn’t know how it had happened. It\n",
      "was a miracle. God could do miracles. God had done this one. God\n",
      "could—God could—could—\n",
      "\n",

      "of all places in the world—but she was clinging to him as she had not\n",
      "clung for years, and murmuring love, and welcoming him. If she welcomed\n",
      "him she must have been expecting him. Strange as this was, it was the\n",

      "\n",
      "Frederick was bewildered. But not being the man to hurt anything if he\n",

      "tenderly as she was kissing him; and presently he was kissing her quite\n",

      "just as if he had never left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was bewildered, but he still could kiss. It seemed curiously natural\n",
      "to be doing it. It made him feel as if he were thirty again instead of\n",
      "forty, and Rose were his Rose of twenty, the Rose he had so much adored\n",
      "before she began to weigh what he did with her idea of right, and the\n",
      "balance went against him, and she had turned strange, and stony, and\n",
      "more and more shocked, and oh, so lamentable. He couldn’t get at her in\n",
      "those days at all; she wouldn’t, she couldn’t understand. She kept on\n",
      "referring everything to what she called God’s eyes—in God’s eyes it\n",
      "couldn’t be right, it wasn’t right. Her miserable face—whatever her\n",
      "principles did for her they didn’t make her happy—her little miserable\n",
      "face, twisted with effort to be patient, had been at last more than he\n",
      "could bear to see, and he had kept away as much as he could. She never\n",
      "ought to have been the daughter of a low-church rector—narrow devil;\n",
      "she was quite unfitted to stand up against such an upbringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had happened, why she was here, why she was his Rose again, passed\n",

      "now who began to murmur, to say love things in her ear under the hair\n",
      "that smelt so sweet and tickled him just as he remembered it used to\n",
      "tickle him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he held her close to his heart and her arms were soft round his\n",
      "neck, he felt stealing over him a delicious sense of—at first he didn’t\n",
      "know what it was, this delicate, pervading warmth, and then he\n",
      "recognised it as security. Yes; security. No need now to be ashamed of\n",
      "his figure, and to make jokes about it so as to forestall other\n",
      "people’s and show he didn’t mind it; no need now to be ashamed of\n",
      "getting hot going up hills, or to torment himself with pictures of how\n",
      "he probably appeared to beautiful young women—how middle-aged, how\n",
      "absurd in his inability to keep away from them. Rose cared nothing for\n",
      "such things. With her he was safe. To her he was her lover, as he used\n",
      "to be; and she would never notice or mind any of the ignoble changes\n",

      "more.\n",

      "Frederick continued, therefore, with greater and greater warmth and\n",
      "growing delight to kiss his wife, and the mere holding of her in\n",
      "his arms caused him to forget everything else. How could he, for\n",
      "instance, remember or think of Lady Caroline, to mention only one of\n",
      "the complications with which his situation bristled, when here was his\n",
      "sweet wife, miraculously restored to him, whispering with her cheek\n",
      "against his in the dearest, most romantic words how much she loved him,\n",
      "how terribly she had missed him? He did for one brief instant, for even\n",

      "the immense power of the woman present and being actually held compared\n",
      "to that of the woman, however beautiful, who is somewhere else, but\n",
      "that is as far as he got towards remembering Scrap; no farther. She was\n",
      "like a dream, fleeing before the morning light.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Didn’t it,” said Frederick, who felt like shutting his eyes himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there had been a letter. Soon, no doubt, light would be vouchsafed\n",
      "him, and meanwhile this was so strangely, touchingly sweet, this\n",
      "holding his Rose to his heart again after all the years, that he\n",
      "couldn’t bother to try to guess anything. Oh, he had been happy during\n",
      "these years, because it was not in him to be unhappy; besides, how many\n",
      "interests life had had to offer him, how many friends, how much\n",
      "success, how many women only too willing to help him to blot out the\n",
      "thought of the altered, petrified, pitiful little wife at home who\n",
      "wouldn’t spend his money, who was appalled by his books, who drifted\n",
      "away and away from him, and always if he tried to have it out with her\n",
      "asked him with patient obstinacy what he thought the things he wrote\n",
      "and lived by looked in the eyes of God. “No one,” she said once,\n",
      "“should ever write a book God wouldn’t like to read. That is the test,\n",
      "Frederick.” And he had laughed hysterically, burst into a great shriek\n",
      "of laughter, and rushed out of the house, away from her solemn little\n",
      "face—away from her pathetic, solemn little face\n",
      "\n",
      "But this Rose was his youth again, the best part of his life, the part\n",
      "of it that had had all the visions in it and all the hopes. How they\n",
      "had dreamed together, he and she, before he struck that vein of\n",
      "memoirs; how they had planned, and laughed, and loved. They had lived\n",
      "for a while in the very heart of poetry. After the happy days came the\n",
      "happy nights, the happy, happy nights, with her asleep close against\n",
      "his heart, with her when he woke in the morning still close against his\n",
      "heart, for they hardly moved in their deep, happy sleep. It was\n",
      "wonderful to have it all come back to him at the touch of her, at the\n",
      "feel of her face against his—wonderful that she should be able to give\n",
      "him back his youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sweetheart—sweetheart,” he murmured, overcome by remembrance, clinging\n",
      "to her now in his turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beloved husband,” she breathed—the bliss of it—the sheer bliss \n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs, coming in a few minutes before the gong went on the chance that\n",
      "Lady Caroline might be there, was much astonished. He had supposed Rose\n",
      "Arbuthnot was a widow, and he still supposed it; so that he was much\n",
      "astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well I’m damned,” thought Briggs, quite clearly and distinctly, for\n",
      "the shock of what he saw in the window startled him so much that for a\n",
      "moment he was shaken free of his own confused absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aloud he said, very red, “Oh I say—I beg your pardon”—and then stood\n",
      "hesitating, and wondering whether he oughtn’t to go back to his bedroom\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had said nothing they would not have noticed he was there, but\n",
      "when he begged their pardon Rose turned and looked at him as one looks\n",
      "who is trying to remember, and Frederick looked at him too without at\n",
      "first quite seeing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn’t seem, thought Briggs, to mind or to be at all embarrassed.\n",
      "He couldn’t be her brother; no brother ever brought that look into a\n",
      "woman’s face. It was very awkward. If they didn’t mind, he did. It\n",
      "upset him to come across his Madonna forgetting herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this one of your friends?” Frederick was able after an instant to\n",
      "ask Rose, who made no attempt to introduce the young man standing\n",
      "awkwardly in front of them but continued to gaze at him with a kind of\n",
      "abstracted, radiant goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s Mr. Briggs,” said Rose, recognizing him. “This is my husband,”\n",
      "she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Briggs, shaking hands, just had time to think how surprising it was\n",
      "to have a husband when you were a widow before the gong sounded, and\n",
      "Lady Caroline would be there in a minute, and he ceased to be able to\n",
      "think at all, and merely became a thing with its eyes fixed on the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the door immediately entered, in what seemed to him an endless\n",
      "procession, first Mrs. Fisher, very stately in her evening lace shawl\n",
      "and brooch, who when she saw him at once relaxed into smiles and\n",
      "benignity, only to stiffen, however, when she caught sight of the\n",
      "stranger; then Mr. Wilkins, cleaner and neater and more carefully\n",
      "dressed and brushed than any man on earth; and then, tying something\n",
      "hurriedly as she came, Mrs. Wilkins; and then nobody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Caroline was late. Where was she? Had she heard the gong? Oughtn’t\n",
      "it to be beaten again? Suppose she didn’t come to dinner after all\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs went cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Introduce me,” said Frederick on Mrs. Fisher’s entrance, touching\n",
      "Rose’s elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My husband,” said Rose, holding him by the hand, her face exquisite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “must now be the last of the husbands,\n",
      "unless Lady Caroline produces one from up her sleeve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But she received him graciously, for he certainly looked exactly like a\n",
      "husband, not at all like one of those people who go about abroad\n",
      "pretending they are husbands when they are not, and said she supposed\n",
      "he had come to accompany his wife home at the end of the month, and\n",
      "remarked that now the house would be completely full. “So that,” she\n",
      "added, smiling at Briggs, “we shall at last really be getting our\n",
      "money’s worth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs grinned automatically, because he was just able to realise that\n",
      "somebody was being playful with him, but he had not heard her and he\n",
      "did not look at her. Not only were his eyes fixed on the door but his\n",
      "whole body was concentrated on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduced in his turn, Mr. Wilkins was most hospitable and called\n",
      "Frederick “sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” said Mr. Wilkins heartily, “here we are, here we are”—and\n",
      "having gripped his hand with an understanding that only wasn’t mutual\n",
      "because Arbuthnot did not yet know what he was in for in the way of\n",
      "trouble, he looked at him as a man should, squarely in the eyes, and\n",
      "allowed his look to convey as plainly as a look can that in him would\n",
      "be found staunchness, integrity, reliability—in fact a friend in need.\n",
      "Mrs. Arbuthnot was very much flushed, Mr. Wilkins noticed. He had not\n",
      "seen her flushed like that before. “Well, I’m their man,” he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty’s greeting was effusive. It was done with both hands. “Didn’t I\n",
      "tell you?” she laughed to Rose over her shoulder while Frederick was\n",
      "shaking her hands in both his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you tell her?” asked Frederick, in order to say something.\n",
      "The way they were all welcoming him was confusing. They had evidently\n",
      "all expected him, not only Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandy but agreeable young woman didn’t answer his question, but\n",
      "looked extraordinarily pleased to see him. Why should she be\n",
      "extraordinarily pleased to see him?\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a delightful place this is,” said Frederick, confused, and making\n",
      "the first remark that occurred to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a tub of love,” said the sandy young woman earnestly; which\n",
      "confused him more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his confusion became excessive at the next words he heard—spoken,\n",
      "these, by the old lady, who said: “We won’t wait. Lady Caroline is\n",
      "always late”—for he only then, on hearing her name, really and properly\n",
      "remembered Lady Caroline, and the thought of her confused him to\n",
      "excess.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went into the dining-room like a man in a dream. He had come out to\n",
      "this place to see Lady Caroline, and had told her so. He had even told\n",
      "her in his fatuousness—it was true, but how fatuous—that he hadn’t been\n",
      "able to help coming. She didn’t know he was married. She thought his\n",
      "name was Arundel. Everybody in London thought his name was Arundel. He\n",
      "had used it and written under it so long that he almost thought it was\n",
      "himself. In the short time since she had left him on the seat in the\n",
      "garden, where he told her he had come because he couldn’t help it, he\n",
      "had found Rose again, had passionately embraced and been embraced, and\n",
      "had forgotten Lady Caroline. It would be an extraordinary piece of good\n",
      "fortune if Lady Caroline’s being late meant she was tired or bored and\n",
      "would not come to dinner at all. Then he could—no, he couldn’t. He\n",
      "turned a deeper red even than usual, he being a man of full habit and\n",
      "red anyhow, at the thought of such cowardice. No, he couldn’t go away\n",
      "after dinner and catch his train and disappear to Rome; not unless,\n",
      "that is, Rose came with him. But even so, what a running away. No, he\n",
      "couldn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got to the dining-room Mrs. Fisher went to the head of the\n",
      "table—was this Mrs. Fisher’s house? he asked himself. He didn’t know;\n",
      "he didn’t know anything—and Rose, who in her earlier days of defying\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher had taken the other end as her place, for after all no one\n",
      "could say by looking at a table which was its top and which its bottom,\n",
      "led Frederick to the seat next to her. If only, he thought, he could\n",
      "have been alone with Rose; just five minutes more alone with Rose, so\n",
      "that he could have asked her—\n",
      "\n",
      "But probably he wouldn’t have asked her anything, and only gone on\n",
      "kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked round. The sandy young woman was telling the man they called\n",
      "Briggs to go and sit beside Mrs. Fisher—was the house, then, the sandy\n",
      "young woman’s and not Mrs. Fisher’s? He didn’t know; he didn’t know\n",
      "anything—and she herself sat down on Rose’s other side, so that she was\n",
      "opposite him, Frederick, and next to the genial man who had said “Here\n",
      "we are,” when it was only too evident that there they were indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to Frederick, and between him and Briggs, was an empty chair: Lady\n",
      "Caroline’s. No more than Lady Caroline knew of the presence in\n",
      "Frederick’s life of Rose was Rose aware of the presence in Frederick’s\n",
      "life of Lady Caroline. What would each think? He didn’t know; he didn’t\n",
      "know anything. Yes, he did know something, and that was that his wife\n",
      "had made it up with him—suddenly, miraculously, unaccountably, and\n",
      "divinely. Beyond that he knew nothing. The situation was one with which\n",
      "he felt he could not cope. It must lead him whither it would. He could\n",
      "only drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "In silence Frederick ate his soup, and the eyes, the large expressive\n",
      "eyes of the young woman opposite, were on him, he could feel, with a\n",
      "growing look in them of inquiry. They were, he could see, very\n",
      "intelligent and attractive eyes, and full, apart from the inquiry of\n",
      "goodwill. Probably she thought he ought to talk—but if she knew\n",
      "everything she wouldn’t think so. Briggs didn’t talk either. Briggs\n",
      "seemed uneasy. What was the matter with Briggs? And Rose too didn’t\n",
      "talk, but then that was natural. She never had been a talker. She had\n",
      "the loveliest expression on her face. How long would it be on it after\n",
      "Lady Caroline’s entrance? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the genial man on Mrs. Fisher’s left was talking enough for\n",
      "everybody. That fellow ought to have been a parson. Pulpits were the\n",
      "place for a voice like his; it would get him a bishopric in six months.\n",
      "He was explaining to Briggs, who shuffled about in his seat—why did\n",
      "Briggs shuffle about in his seat?—that he must have come out by the\n",
      "same train as Arbuthnot, and when Briggs, who said nothing, wriggled in\n",
      "apparent dissent, he undertook to prove it to him, and did prove it to\n",
      "him in long clear sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s the man with the voice?” Frederick asked Rose in a whisper; and\n",
      "the young woman opposite, whose ears appeared to have the quickness of\n",
      "hearing of wild creatures, answered, “He’s my husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then by all the rules,” said Frederick pleasantly, pulling himself\n",
      "together, “you oughtn’t to be sitting next to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I want to. I like sitting next to him. I didn’t before I came\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick could think of nothing to say to this, so he only smiled\n",
      "generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s this place,” she said, nodding at him. “It makes one understand.\n",
      "You’ve no idea what a lot you’ll understand before you’ve done here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure I hope so,” said Frederick with real fervour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soup was taken away, and the fish was brought. Briggs, on the other\n",
      "side of the empty chair, seemed more uneasy than ever. What was the\n",
      "matter with Briggs? Didn’t he like fish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick wondered what Briggs would do in the way of fidgets if he\n",
      "were in his own situation. Frederick kept on wiping his moustache, and\n",
      "was not able to look up from his plate, but that was as much as he\n",
      "showed of what he was feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he didn’t look up he felt the eyes of the young woman opposite\n",
      "raking him like searchlights, and Rose’s eyes were on him too, he knew,\n",
      "but they rested on him unquestioningly, beautifully, like a\n",
      "benediction. How long would they go on doing that once Lady Caroline\n",
      "was there? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wiped his moustache for the twentieth unnecessary time, and could\n",
      "not quite keep his hand steady, and the young woman opposite saw his\n",
      "hand not being quite steady, and her eyes raked him persistently. Why\n",
      "did her eyes rake him persistently? He didn’t know; he didn’t know\n",
      "anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Briggs leapt to his feet. What was the matter with Briggs?\n",
      "Oh—yes—quite: she had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick wiped his moustache and got up too. He was in for it now.\n",
      "Absurd, fantastic situation. Well, whatever happened he could only\n",
      "drift—drift, and look like an ass to Lady Caroline, the most absolute\n",

      "That evening was the evening of the full moon. The garden was an\n",
      "enchanted place where all the flowers seemed white. The lilies, the\n",
      "daphnes, the orange-blossom, the white stocks, the white pinks, the\n",
      "white roses—you could see these as plainly as in the day-time; but the\n",

      "\n",
      "The three younger women sat on the low wall at the end of the top\n",
      "garden after dinner, Rose a little apart from the others, and watched\n",
      "the enormous moon moving slowly over the place where Shelley had lived\n",
      "his last months just on a hundred years before. The sea quivered along\n",
      "the path of the moon. The stars winked and trembled. The mountains were\n",
      "misty blue outlines, with little clusters of lights shining through\n",
      "from little clusters of homes. In the garden the plants stood quite\n",
      "still, straight and unstirred by the smallest ruffle of air. Through\n",

      "brilliant flowers—nasturtiums and marigolds that night—glowed like some\n",

      "strangely animated figures seen from the silence, the huge cool calm of\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher had gone to the drawing-room and the fire. Scrap and Lotty,\n",
      "their faces upturned to the sky, said very little and in whispers. Rose\n",
      "said nothing. Her face too was upturned. She was looking at the\n",
      "umbrella pine, which had been smitten into something glorious,\n",
      "silhouetted against stars. Every now and then Scrap’s eyes lingered on\n",
      "Rose; so did Lotty’s. For Rose was lovely. Anywhere at that moment,\n",
      "among all the well-known beauties, she would have been lovely. Nobody\n",
      "could have put her in the shade, blown out her light that evening; she\n",
      "was too evidently shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty bent close to Scrap’s ear, and whispered. “Love,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap nodded. “Yes,” she said, under her breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obliged to admit it. You only had to look at Rose to know that\n",
      "here was Love.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nothing like it,” whispered Lotty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a great thing,” whispered Lotty after a pause, during which they\n",
      "both watched Rose’s upturned face, “to get on with one’s loving.\n",
      "Perhaps you can tell me of anything else in the world that works such\n",
      "wonders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrap couldn’t tell her; and if she could have, what a night to\n",
      "begin arguing in. This was a night for—\n",
      "\n",
      "She pulled herself up. Love again. It was everywhere. There was no\n",
      "getting away from it. She had come to this place to get away from it,\n",
      "and here was everybody in its different stages. Even Mrs. Fisher seemed\n",
      "to have been brushed by one of the many feathers of Love’s wing, and at\n",
      "dinner was different—full of concern because Mr. Briggs wouldn’t eat,\n",
      "and her face when she turned to him all soft with motherliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap looked up at the pine-tree motionless among stars. Beauty made\n",
      "you love, and love made you beautiful\n",
      "\n",
      "She pulled her wrap closer round her with a gesture of defence, of\n",
      "keeping out and off. She didn’t want to grow sentimental. Difficult not\n",
      "to, here; the marvellous night stole in through all one’s chinks, and\n",
      "brought in with it, whether one wanted them or not, enormous\n",
      "feelings—feelings one couldn’t manage, great things about death and\n",
      "time and waste; glorious and devastating things, magnificent and bleak,\n",
      "at once rapture and terror and immense, heart-cleaving longing. She\n",
      "felt small and dreadfully alone. She felt uncovered and defenceless.\n",
      "Instinctively she pulled her wrap closer. With this thing of chiffon\n",
      "she tried to protect herself from the eternities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose,” whispered Lotty, “Rose’s husband seems to you just an\n",
      "ordinary, good-natured, middle-aged man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap brought her gaze down from the stars and looked at Lotty a moment\n",
      "while she focussed her mind again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just a rather red, rather round man,” whispered Lotty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap bowed her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He isn’t,” whispered Lotty. “Rose sees through all that. That’s mere\n",
      "trimmings. She sees what we can’t see, because she loves him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Always love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap got up, and winding herself very tightly in her wrap moved away\n",
      "to her day corner, and sat down there alone on the wall and looked out\n",
      "across the other sea, the sea where the sun had gone down, the sea with\n",
      "the far-away dim shadow stretching into it which was France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, love worked wonders, and Mr. Arundel—she couldn’t at once get used\n",
      "to his other name—was to Rose Love itself; but it also worked inverted\n",
      "wonders, it didn’t invariably, as she well knew, transfigure people\n",
      "into saints and angels. Grievously indeed did it sometimes do the\n",
      "opposite. She had had it in her life applied to her to excess. If it\n",
      "had let her alone, if it had at least been moderate and infrequent, she\n",
      "might, she thought, have turned out a quite decent, generous-minded,\n",
      "kindly, human being. And what was she, thanks to this love Lotty talked\n",
      "so much about? Scrap searched for a just description. She was a spoilt,\n",
      "a sour, a suspicious, and a selfish spinster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass doors of the dining-room opened, and the three men came out\n",
      "into the garden, Mr. Wilkins’s voice flowing along in front of them. He\n",
      "appeared to be doing all the talking; the other two were saying\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she had better go back to Lotty and Rose; it would be tiresome\n",
      "to be discovered and hemmed into thate cul-de-sac by Mr. Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got up reluctantly, for she considered it unpardonable of Mr.\n",
      "Briggs to force her to move about like this, to force her out of any\n",
      "place she wished to sit in; and she emerged from the daphne bushes\n",
      "feeling like some gaunt, stern figure of just resentment and wishing\n",
      "that she looked as gaunt and stern as she felt; so would she have\n",
      "struck repugnance into the soul of Mr. Briggs, and been free of him.\n",
      "But she knew she didn’t look like that, however hard she might try. At\n",
      "dinner his hand shook when he drank, and he couldn’t speak to her\n",
      "without flushing scarlet and then going pale, and Mrs. Fisher’s eyes\n",
      "had sought hers with the entreaty of one who asks that her only son may\n",
      "not be hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could a human being, thought Scrap, frowning as she issued forth\n",
      "from her corner, how could a man made in God’s image behave so; and he\n",
      "fitted for better things she was sure, with his youth, his\n",
      "attractiveness, and his brains. He had brains. She had examined him\n",
      "cautiously whenever at dinner Mrs. Fisher forced him to turn away to\n",
      "answer her, and she was sure he had brains. Also he had character;\n",
      "there was something noble about his head, about the shape of his\n",
      "forehead—noble and kind. All the more deplorable that he should allow\n",
      "himself to be infatuated by a mere outside, and waste any of his\n",
      "strength, any of his peace of mind, hanging round just a woman-thing.\n",
      "If only he could see right through her, see through all her skin and\n",
      "stuff, he would be cured, and she might go on sitting undisturbed on\n",
      "this wonderful night by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just beyond the daphne bushes she met Frederick, hurrying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was determined to find you first,” he said, “before I go to Rose.”\n",
      "And he added quickly, “I want to kiss your shoes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you?” said Scrap, smiling. “Then I must go and put on my new ones.\n",
      "These aren’t nearly good enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt immensely well-disposed towards Frederick. He, at least, would\n",
      "grab no more. His grabbing days, so sudden and so brief, were done.\n",
      "Nice man; agreeable man. She now definitely liked him. Clearly he had\n",
      "been getting into some sort of a tangle, and she was grateful to Lotty\n",
      "for stopping her in time at dinner from saying something hopelessly\n",
      "complicating. But whatever he had been getting into he was out of it\n",
      "now; his face and Rose’s face had the same light in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall adore you for ever now,” said Frederick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap smiled. “Shall you?” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I adored you before because of your beauty. Now I adore you because\n",
      "you’re not only as beautiful as a dream but as decent as a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrap laughed. “Am I?” she said, amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When the impetuous young woman,” Frederick went on, “the blessedly\n",
      "impetuous young woman, blurted out in the nick of time that I am Rose’s\n",
      "husband, you behaved exactly as a man would have behaved to his\n",
      "friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I?” said Scrap, her enchanting dimple very evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the rarest, most precious of combinations,” said Frederick, “to\n",
      "be a woman and have the loyalty of a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it?” smiled Scrap, a little wistfully. These were indeed handsome\n",
      "compliments. If only she were really like that \n",
      "\n",
      "“And I want to kiss your shoes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won’t this save trouble?” she asked, holding out her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took it and swiftly kissed it, and was hurrying away again. “Bless\n",
      "you,” he said as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is your luggage?” Scrap called after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Lord, yes—” said Frederick, pausing. “It’s at the station.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll send for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He disappeared through the bushes. She went indoors to give the order;\n",
      "and this is how it happened that Domenico, for the second time that\n",
      "evening, found himself journeying into Mezzago and wondering as he\n",
      "went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, having made the necessary arrangements for the perfect happiness\n",
      "of these two people, she came slowly out into the garden again, very\n",
      "much absorbed in thought. Love seemed to bring happiness to everybody\n",
      "but herself. It had certainly got hold of everybody there, in its\n",
      "different varieties, except herself. Poor Mr. Briggs had been got hold\n",
      "of by its least dignified variety. Poor Mr. Briggs. He was a disturbing\n",
      "problem, and his going away next day wouldn’t she was afraid solve him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she reached the others Mr. Arundel—she kept on forgetting that he\n",
      "wasn’t Mr. Arundel—was already, his arm through Rose’s, going off with\n",
      "her, probably to the greater seclusion of the lower garden. No doubt\n",
      "they had a great deal to say to each other; something had gone wrong\n",
      "between them, and had suddenly been put right. San Salvatore, Lotty\n",
      "would say, San Salvatore working its spell of happiness. She could\n",
      "quite believe in its spell. Even she was happier there than she had\n",
      "been for ages and ages. The only person who would go empty away would\n",
      "be Mr. Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Briggs. When she came in sight of the group he looked much too\n",
      "nice and boyish not to be happy. It seemed out of the picture that the\n",
      "owner of the place, the person to whom they owed all this, should be\n",
      "the only one to go away from it unblessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compunction seized Scrap. What very pleasant days she had spent in his\n",
      "house, lying in his garden, enjoying his flowers, loving his views,\n",
      "using his things, being comfortable, being rested—recovering, in fact.\n",
      "She had had the most leisured, peaceful, and thoughtful time of her\n",
      "life; and all really thanks to him. Oh, she knew she paid him some\n",
      "ridiculous small sum a week, out of all proportion to the benefits she\n",
      "got in exchange, but what was that in the balance? And wasn’t it\n",
      "entirely thanks to him that she had come across Lotty? Never else would\n",
      "she and Lotty have met; never else would she have known her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compunction laid its quick, warm hand on Scrap. Impulsive gratitude\n",
      "flooded her. She went straight up to Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I owe you so much,” she said, overcome by the sudden realisation of\n",
      "all she did owe him, and ashamed of her churlishness in the afternoon\n",
      "and at dinner. Of course he hadn’t known she was being churlish. Of\n",
      "course her disagreeable inside was camouflaged as usual by the chance\n",
      "arrangement of her outside; but she knew it. She was churlish. She had\n",
      "been churlish to everybody for years. Any penetrating eye, thought\n",
      "Scrap, any really penetrating eye, would see her for what she was—a\n",
      "spoilt, a sour, a suspicious and a selfish spinster.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I owe you so much,” therefore said Scrap earnestly, walking straight\n",
      "up to Briggs, humbled by these thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her in wonder. “You owe me?” he said. “But it’s I\n",
      "who—I who—” he stammered. To see her there in his garden  nothing\n",
      "in it, no white flower, was whiter, more exquisite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please,” said Scrap, still more earnestly, “won’t you clear your mind\n",
      "of everything except just truth? You don’t owe me anything. How should\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t owe you anything?” echoed Briggs. “Why, I owe you my first\n",
      "sight of—of—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, for goodness sake—for goodness sake,” said Scrap entreatingly,\n",
      "“do, please, be ordinary. Don’t be humble. Why should you be humble?\n",
      "It’s ridiculous of you to be humble. You’re worth fifty of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unwise,” thought Mr. Wilkins, who was standing there too, while Lotty\n",
      "sat on the wall. He was surprised, he was concerned, he was shocked\n",
      "that Lady Caroline should thus encourage Briggs. “Unwise—very,”\n",
      "thought Mr. Wilkins, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs’s condition was so bad already that the only course to take with\n",
      "him was to repel him utterly, Mr. Wilkins considered. No half measures\n",
      "were the least use with Briggs, and kindliness and familiar talk would\n",
      "only be misunderstood by the unhappy youth. The daughter of the\n",
      "Droitwiches could not really, it was impossible to suppose it, desire\n",
      "to encourage him. Briggs was all very well, but Briggs was Briggs; his\n",
      "name alone proved that. Probably Lady Caroline did not quite appreciate\n",
      "the effect of her voice and face, and how between them they made\n",
      "otherwise ordinary words seem—well, encouraging. But these words were\n",
      "not quite ordinary; she had not, he feared, sufficiently pondered them.\n",
      "Indeed and indeed she needed an adviser—some sagacious, objective\n",
      "counsellor like himself. There she was, standing before Briggs almost\n",
      "holding out her hands to him. Briggs of course ought to be thanked, for\n",
      "they were having a most delightful holiday in his house, but not\n",
      "thanked to excess and not by Lady Caroline alone. That very evening he\n",
      "had been considering the presentation to him next day of a round robin\n",
      "of collective gratitude on his departure; but he should not be thanked\n",
      "like this, in the moonlight, in the garden, by the lady he was so\n",
      "manifestly infatuated with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins therefore, desiring to assist Lady Caroline out of this\n",
      "situation by swiftly applied tact, said with much heartiness: “It is\n",
      "most proper, Briggs, that you should be thanked. You will please allow\n",
      "me to add my expressions of indebtedness, and those of my wife, to Lady\n",
      "Caroline’s. We ought to have proposed a vote of thanks to you at\n",
      "dinner. You should have been toasted. There certainly ought to have\n",
      "been some—”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Briggs took no notice of him whatever; he simply continued to look\n",
      "at Lady Caroline as though she were the first woman he had ever seen.\n",
      "Neither, Mr. Wilkins observed, did Lady Caroline take any notice of\n",
      "him; she too continued to look at Briggs, and with that odd air of\n",
      "almost appeal. Most unwise. Most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotty, on the other hand, took too much notice of him, choosing this\n",
      "moment when Lady Caroline needed special support and protection to get\n",
      "up off the wall and put her arm through his and draw him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to tell you something, Mellersh,” said Lotty at this juncture,\n",
      "getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Presently,” said Mr. Wilkins, waving her aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No—now,” said Lotty; and she drew him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went with extreme reluctance. Briggs should be given no rope at\n",
      "all—not an inch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well—what is it?” he asked impatiently, as she led him towards the\n",
      "house. Lady Caroline ought not to be left like that, exposed to\n",
      "annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but she isn’t,” Lotty assured him, just as if he had said this\n",
      "aloud, which he certainly had not. “Caroline is perfectly all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all all right. That young Briggs is—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he is. What did you expect? Let’s go indoors to the fire and\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher. She’s all by herself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot,” said Mr. Wilkins, trying to draw back, “leave Lady Caroline\n",
      "alone in the garden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be silly, Mellersh—she isn’t alone. Besides, I want to tell you\n",
      "something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well tell me, then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indoors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a reluctance that increased at every step Mr. Wilkins was taken\n",
      "farther and farther away from Lady Caroline. He believed in his wife\n",
      "now and trusted her, but on this occasion he thought she was making a\n",
      "terrible mistake. In the drawing-room sat Mrs. Fisher by the fire, and\n",
      "it certainly was to Mr. Wilkins, who preferred rooms and fires after\n",
      "dark to gardens and moonlight, more agreeable to be in there than\n",
      "out-of-doors if he could have brought Lady Caroline safely in with him.\n",
      "As it was, he went in with extreme reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Fisher, her hands folded on her lap, was doing nothing, merely\n",
      "gazing fixedly into the fire. The lamp was arranged conveniently for\n",
      "reading, but she was not reading. Her great dead friends did not seem\n",
      "worth reading that night. They always said the same things now—over and\n",
      "over again they said the same things, and nothing new was to be got out\n",
      "of them any more for ever. No doubt they were greater than any one was\n",
      "now, but they had this immense disadvantage, that they were dead.\n",
      "Nothing further was to be expected of them; while of the living, what\n",
      "might one not still expect? She craved for the living, the\n",
      "developing—the crystallised and finished wearied her. She was thinking\n",
      "that if only she had had a son—a son like Mr. Briggs, a dear boy like\n",
      "that, going on, unfolding, alive, affectionate, taking care of her and\n",
      "loving her\n",
      "\n",

      "This time Mrs. Fisher actually put up her hand and held Mrs. Wilkins’s\n",

      "\n",
      "Both Mr. Wilkins and Mrs. Fisher started. Mr. Wilkins, usually in such\n",

      "for the first time since his arrival felt angry with his wife.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“The Briggses!” cried Mr. Wilkins, now very angry indeed; for the\n",
      "implication was to him a most outrageous insult to the entire race of\n",
      "Desters—dead Desters, living Desters, and Desters still harmless\n",
      "because they were yet unborn. “Really—”\n",
      "\n",

      "that had so much surprised Rose the first time they met.\n",

      "“It’s useless minding,” she said. “I shouldn’t struggle if I were you.\n",
      "Because—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped, and looked first at one alarmed solemn face and then at\n",
      "the other, and laughter as well as light flickered and danced over her.\n",
